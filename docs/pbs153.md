# PBS 153 of X — Bash: Functions & Scope

We're very near the end of our exploration of Bash, but we're missing one vital tool from our toolbox — easy code re-use through functions. As things stand, if we want to use the same lines of code multiple times, we need to copy and paste them, and in software engineering jargon, that\'s one heck of a *bad smell*!

In this instalment we'll learn how to use POSIX functions to re-use Bash code efficiently, and in the process, we'll be forced to grapple with the unusual way in which shell scripts handle scope. Most languages, including JavaScript and PHP, use *lexical scope*, but POSIX-compliant shell scripting languages like Bash use a completely different approach, *dynamic scope*. There is no right or wrong here, the key point is that shell script deals with scope differently to most other languages you're likely to meet, so you need to keep that in mind as you script, or you'll be bamboozled by *spooky action at a distance* errors that you don't understand.

## PBS 152 Challenge Solution

The challenge set at the end of the previous instalment was to update your solution to the previous challenge (to print multiplication tables) to make use of arithmetic expressions and/or `xargs` to improve your code as appropriate.

You'll find my full sample solution in the instalment ZIP as `pbs152-challengeSolution.sh`, but it's largely unchanged because I was already using `xargs`. All that remained for me to do was convert calls to the basic calculator (`bc`) to arithmetic expressions. For the most part, those changes were very mundane, e.g.:

```bash
capLen=$(echo "8+$nLen+$maxMLen+$maxPLen" | bc)
```

Became:

```bash
capLen=$(( 8 + nLen + maxMLen + maxPLen ))
```

However, this is one change that's worth a deeper look.

### Cleaner `optargs` with an Arithmetic Expression

We know that when we're done processing optional arguments with `optargs` we need to use the `shift` command to clean the appropriate amount of entries from the front of the arguments array. We need to shift by one less than the value of `$OPTIND`, so we have been doing that by using the `bc` command like so:

```bash
shift $(echo "$OPTIND-1" | bc)
```

We can now make this line easier to read and understand with an arithmetic expression:

```bash
shift $(( OPTIND - 1 ))
```

## Introducing Functions

As we've mentioned before, Bash is a super-set of the POSIX standard. That means it supports multiple different syntaxes for defining functions. In this series we're only going to use one of those syntaxes — the one defined in the POSIX standard. The advantage of learning to write POSIX functions rather than Bash functions is that our syntax will work in other shell scripting languages too.

### Think of Functions as Custom Terminal Commands

When we were learning JavaScript we described functions as black boxes that take input and produce output. If you squint at POSIX functions just right, they do fit that model, but for your sanity, you should probably not think of POSIX functions that way. Instead, think of POSIX functions as custom terminal commands you get define.

POSIX functions **can accept arguments**, and they **can alter variables**, but, like other terminal commands, their **primary IO is via the standard POSIX streams** ( `STDIN`, `STDOUT`, and `STDERR`). We know that each time we execute a terminal command or a shell script, that command or script gets its own streams, which default to inheriting from the calling process, but can be changed using the stream redirection operators like `|` , `>` etc.. Also, like regular terminal commands and scripts, **the return value from a POSIX function is an exit code**, specifically, the exit code of the last command executed within the function.

### The POSIX Function Syntax

A POSIX function is simply a named sequence of terminal commands, and the syntax is simply:

```bash
FUNCTION_NAME () {
  # TERMINAL COMMANDS
}
```

**Beware — never put anything into those round brackets!** Those of us who have used C-style programming languages like JavaScript are probably expecting those parentheses to be some kind of placeholder where we define the function's arguments, but no, that's not how POSIX works! The only purpose those parens serve is to mark the start of a function definition — think of them as a single symbol that means *"this is a function"*.

Once a function has been defined, you use it as if it were a standard terminal command.

As a simple example, let's look at `pbs153a-fn.sh` in the instalment ZIP:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# store the number of times to call the function
fnCounter=3
echo "$1" | egrep '^\d+$' -q && fnCounter=$1

# define a POSIX Hello World fuction
# Arguments: NONE
hellow () {
    echo 'Hello World!'
    echo '(from inside a POSIX function)'
}

# call simple greeting function the appropriate number of times
while (( fnCounter > 0 )) # NOTE the arithmetic expression
do
    # call the function
    hellow

    # decrement the counter with an arithmetic expression
    (( fnCounter-- ))

    # print an empty line unless done
    (( fnCounter > 0 )) && echo ''
done
```

This script defines a POSIX function named `hellow`, then calls it once by default, or, the number of times specified in the first argument to the script, e.g.:

```text
$ ./pbs153a-fn.sh
Hello World!
(from inside a POSIX function)
$ ./pbs153a-fn.sh 3
Hello World!
(from inside a POSIX function)

Hello World!
(from inside a POSIX function)

Hello World!
(from inside a POSIX function)
$ 
```

The key points to note is that we define the function `hellow` like so:

```bash
hellow () {
    echo 'Hello World!'
    echo '(from inside a POSIX function)'
}
```

And we call with with simply:

```bash
hellow
```

As a quick aside, note the script's use of arithmetic expressions for making numeric comparisons and decrementing the counter.

As we learned in the previous instalment, arithmetic expressions without a leading `$` evaluate to an exit code, and inside arithmetic expressions, variable names do not get prefixed with `$`, so to print a new line only when the counter is greater than zero we can simply use:

```bash
 (( fnCounter > 0 )) && echo ''
```

Similarly, I used an arithmetic expression to decrement the counter:

```bash
  (( fnCounter-- ))
```
