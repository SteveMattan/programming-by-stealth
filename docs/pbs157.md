# PBS 157 of X â€” Querying JSON with `jq`

So far in this mini-series we've looked at how jq can be used to [pretty-print JSON](./pbs155) and to [extract specific pieces of information](./pbs156), in this instalment we're taking things to the next level by working our way towards querying JSON data structures for information like it were a database.

In this instalment we're going to work our way towards answering questions like *who won the 2000 Nobel Prize for Medicine?*, and *which prizes were won by people with the surname Einstein?*

To get to our desired queries we're going to need to explore three important jq concepts:

1. Filter chaining
2. Operators
3. Functions

## Filter Chaining

The key to doing powerful things with jq is not writing complex filters, but combining many simply filters to build powerful flows. This is the same philosophy underpinning shell programming and terminal commands. Perhaps because it's so heavily inspired by shell programming, jq has chosen to use very similar syntax. This is a blessing and a curse, because it makes jq filter chains intuitive to those comfortable on the terminal, and, very prone to breaking when you forget to quote your filters correctly, and it's the shell that sees your pipes, not jq!

So, a timely reminder, when using the `jq` command, **always single-quote your filters!**

In the previous instalment we learned that jq filters are designed to work in parallel on arbitrarily many inputs, and each input can be dropped, or, exploded into multiple outputs. We can use the `|` symbol to route the output of one jq filter to become the input to another.

As in our previous jq instalments, we'll be using the file `NobelPrizes.json` (in the Instalment's ZIP file) for our examples. It contains a JSON data structure that stores information about all Nobel Prizes up to and including those announced in 2023. At the top level there is a dictionary with one key, `prizes` which maps to an array of dictionaries, one for each prize.

To get started  with filter changing, let's combine a filter to explode the array of prizes into separate values, and then chain that with a pair of very simple filters to extract the year and category of each prize:

```bash
jq '.prizes[] | .year, .category' NobelPrizes.json
```

In the previous instalment we saw that empty square braces explodes an array into separate values, and that we can use the comma (`,`) to run multiple filters against each input. 

As you start to combine more and more filters, you'll inevitably reach a point where you need to group filters so they get applied in the right order, jq uses regular parentheses for this (AKA *round brackets*, i.e. `()`).

If we want to expand our query above to also list the surnames of each recipient of each prize, we need to add another filter after `.caregory`, but since the laureates are in an array, we actually need two more filters, one to explode the laureates, and one to extract the surnames. If we just add `.laureates[] | .surname` we have a problem, the new pipe is seen as ending a triplet of filters (`.year`, `.category` & `.laureats`) an starting a third top-level filter, not as a sub-filter of our new third filter. We need to group these last two filters together with parentheses.

Finally, the prizes were suspended for some war years, so there are entries in the data structure without `laureates` array, so we need to use the `?` symbol to indicate that it's OK for `.laureats[]` to produce zero outputs. Putting it all together we get:

```bash
jq '.prizes[] | .year, .category, (.laureates[]? | .surname)' NobelPrizes.json
```

## Operators in jq

Like other programming languages, jq supports operators, i.e. symbols or keywords that apply some kind of operation to the values to their left and right to produce a new value. We'll meet more operators later in the series, but let's start with those most relevant for querying data â€” comparison and boolean operators.

To help us experiment with the various operators, it's useful to learn how to execute the `jq` command with no input. If you try to run the command without passing it any files or piping something into it, `jq` tries to read from the keyboard, which is not always what you want. To explicitly tell `jq` not to expect any input, use the `--null-input` or `-n` flag.

### Comparison Operators

The comparison operators all generate boolean values, and the jq language supports the usual array of operators you would expect.

We can check for equality or non-equality with `==` or `!=`, we can check if one number is less than another, or one string is alphabetically before another,  with `<`, and the opposite with `>`, and there are the *or equal to* variations you'd expect too, i.e. `<=` and `>=`.

We can demonstrate these with some simply filters that don't take any input:

```bash
# is equal to
jq -n '"waffles" == "waffles"' # true
jq -n '"waffles" == "pancakes"' # false

# is not equal to
jq -n '"waffles" != "waffles"' # false
jq -n '"waffles" != "pancakes"' # true

# is less than
jq -n '42 < 2' # false
jq -n '42 < 42' # false
jq -n '42 < 442' # true

# is less than or equal to
jq -n '42 <= 2' # false
jq -n '42 <= 42' # true
jq -n '42 <= 442' # true

# is greater than
jq -n '42 > 2' # true
jq -n '42 > 42' # false
jq -n '42 > 442' # false

# is greater than or equal to
jq -n '42 >= 2' # true
jq -n '42 >= 42' # true
jq -n '42 >= 442' # false

```

One thing to watch out for is that **the jq equality operators behave like the strict equality operators in JavaScript** (i.e. like `===` & `!==`) â€” in other words, to be considered equal, the values **and** types must be the same. That means that jq does not consider the number `42` and the string `"42"` to be equal:

```bash
jq -n '42 == 2' # false
jq -n '42 == 42' # true
jq -n '42 == "42"' # false
```

### Boolean Operators

The jq language allows you to combine boolean values using the `and`, and `or` operators. These will cast the values they process to a booleans, and in jq, e**verything that's not `false` or `null` is considered `true`**, and that includes `0`, empty arrays, and empty dictionaries:

```bash
jq -n 'true and true' # true
jq -n 'true and false' # false
jq -n 'true and null' # false
jq -n 'true and 0' # true
jq -n 'true and "false"' # true
echo 'false' | jq 'true and .' # false - send JSON for the boolean false via STDIN
echo '[]' | jq 'true and .' # true - send JSON for an empty array via STDIN
echo '{}' | jq 'true and .' # true - send JSON for an empty dictionary via STDIN
```

Note that there is no `not` operator in the jq language, but there is a `not` function, which brings us nicely to functions ðŸ™‚

## Functions in jq

In jq functions are used within filters, so they have implicit access to the filter's input (i.e. `.`), which means many functions don't need any arguments at all. To call a function without arguments, simply use its name.

As you would expect, jq functions can take optional additional inputs in the form of arguments. To call a function with arguments, append them to the function name in regular round brackets, separated by semi-colons (`;`). So, in jq function calls take forms like:

```jq
# no arguments
functionName

# one argument
functionName(firstArgument)

# two arguments
functionName(firstArgument; secondArgument)
```

When it comes to return values, jq functions behave like jq filters, producing zero, one, or more outputs.

Something that might surprise you, but will prove extremely useful, is that functions can take filters as arguments.

### The `not` Function

As mentioned before, in jq, there is no operator for boolean inversion, instead, we have a function named `not` which takes no arguments and returns `true` if `.` evaluates to `false`, and `false` if it evaluates to `true`. To use `not` simply add it in a filter pipeline after the boolean value to be inverted has been calculated. Here's a rather contrived example:

```bash
jq -n 'true and true | not' # false
```

## Introducing the `any` and `all` Functions

`not` isn't the only boolean function jq provides, there is also the very useful pair of `any` and `all`. These two functions both come in three variants, one of which we'll ignore for now.

The first form is the simplest â€” the functions expect to be passed an array as the current item to be processed (`.`), and no arguments.  Both functions will cast every value in the input array to a `boolean`, and if any of them are `true` the `any` function will return `true`, if all of them are `true` the `all` function will returns `true`, and in all other cases, both functions will return `false`. That's a complex way of saying *"they do what their name implies they would"*!

# Examples to work towards

```jq
# the laureates for the 2000 medecine prize
jq '.prizes[]|select(.year == "2000")|select(.category == "medicine")|.laureates[]' NobelPrizes.json

# The prizes won by someone with the surname Einstein â€” take 1 (throws error)
jq '.prizes[]|select(any(.laureates[]; .surname == "Einstein"))' NobelPrizes.json

# the reason for the error â€” there are prizes with no laureats!
jq '.prizes[]|select((.laureates | length) == 0)' NobelPrizes.json

# the solution to the error â€” make the expansion of the laureats conditional
jq '.prizes[]|select(any(.laureates[]?; .surname == "Einstein"))' NobelPrizes.json
```
