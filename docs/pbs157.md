# PBS 157 of X — Querying JSON with `jq`

So far in this mini-series we've looked at how jq can be used to [pretty-print JSON](./pbs155) and to [extract specific pieces of information](./pbs156), in this instalment we're taking things to the next level by learning how to query JSON looking for specific pieces of information.

## Functions in jq

In order query JSON we need to use our first jq functions, `map` and `select`, so we need to start this instalment with a look at how jq functions work in general before we dive into these two specific functions.

In jq functions are used within filters, so they have access to the filter's input (i.e. `.`) automatically, which means many functions don't need any arguments at all. To call a function without arguments, simply use its name.

Functions can take optional additional inputs in the form of arguments by appending them to the function name in regular round brackets separated by semi-colons (`;`). So, in jq function calls take forms like:

```text
functionName
functionName(firstArgument)
functionName(firstArgument; secondArgument)
```

When it comes to return values, jq functions behave like jq filters, producing zero, one, or more outputs.
