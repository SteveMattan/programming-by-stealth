# PBS 158+ jq Roadmap

## The Alternate Operator

One of the advantages JSON offers over more rigid data structures like CSV files and traditional relational databases is the flexibility for each piece of data to have a different structure to the others. You can have an array of dictionaries each defining different key-value pairs in JSON, or, you can have the same key map to data of a completely different type from one dictionary to the next.

A very common example is how APIs treat data fields that can have zero, one, or more values. The API may decide to omit the key completely if there are no values for it, add it as a string if there is one value, or an array of strings if there are more values. This is easy for a human to read, but difficult to query with jq because the you need to accommodate the different possibilities without triggering errors.

We have an example of this in the Nobel Prizes dataset we've been using in our examples throughout this series â€” when a Nobel Prize is awarded, the dictionary representing the prize has a key named `laureates` which is an array of dictionaries, each representing a winner, but on the years there was no prize the `laureates` key is completely missing, being replaced instead by a different key named `overallMotivation` which maps to a string explaining what was done with the prize money that was not awarded.

TO DO â€” Example

## Select-like Functions

Like `select` these functions either pass or don't pass the input to the output based on a criteria, but unlike with `select`, the criteria is pre-defined, so they don't take any arguments. These are intended as *'does exactly what it says on the tin'* functions ðŸ˜‰

It's easier to show what these functions do with code snippets than to try describe them, and to help us do that we'll use the file `sampleData.json` which contains a top-level array containing entries of different data types:

```json
[
  null,
  true,
  -1,
  0,
  11,
  3.1415,
  "42",
  "waffles",
  [],
  ["dogs", "cats"],
  {},
  {"apples": 12, "pears": 3}
]
```



```bash
# select all nulls (only really useful if you want to check if there are any or count them)
jq '.[] | nulls' sampleData.json
# null

# select everything that's not null
jq '.[] | values' sampleData.json
# true
# -1
# 0
# 11
# 3.1415
# "42"
# "waffles"
# []
# [
#   "dogs",
#   "cats"
# ]
# {}
# {
#   "apples": 12,
#   "pears": 3
# }

# select all booleans
jq '.[] | booleans' sampleData.json
# true

# select all numbers
jq '.[] | numbers' sampleData.json
# -1
# 0
# 11
# 3.1415
# Note: the string "42" is not selected because strict types are used

# select all strings
jq '.[] | strings' sampleData.json
# "42"
# "waffles"

# select all arrays
jq '.[] | arrays' sampleData.json
# []
# [
#   "dogs",
#   "cats"
# ]
# Note: the empty array gets returned

# select all dictionaries
jq '.[] | objects' sampleData.json
# {}
# {
#   "apples": 12,
#   "pears": 3
# }
# Note: the empty dictionary gets returned

# select all things you can loop over (arrays or dictionaries)
jq '.[] | iterables' sampleData.json
# []
# [
#   "dogs",
#   "cats"
# ]
# {}
# {
#   "apples": 12,
#   "pears": 3
# }

# select everything that's a single value (i.e. that you can't loop over)
jq '.[] | scalars' sampleData.json
# null
# true
# -1
# 0
# 11
# 3.1415
# "42"
# "waffles"
```

### String Interpolation

Build a string describing Andrea Ghez's prize:

```bash
jq '.prizes[] | .laureates[]? | select(.surname == "Ghez") | "\(.firstname) \(.surname) was awarded her prize for \(.motivation)"' NobelPrizes.json --raw-output
# Andrea Ghez was awarded her prize for "for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy"
```

### Array Construction

Most common use is to re-combine multiple outputs from a filter into a single array for final output or to pipe to the next filter in the chain.

Often used as a syntactically shorter alternative to the `map` function.

### Dictionary Construction

Get the details of Dr. Andrea Ghez's Nobel prize as a new dictionary:

```bash
# Basic example â€” just extract top-level values
jq '.prizes[] | select(any(.laureates[]?; .surname == "Ghez")) | {year: .year, prize: .category}' NobelPrizes.json
# {
#  "year": "2020",
#  "prize": "physics"
# }

# Complex example â€” combine top-level and lower-level data, use string interpolation, and use string substitution
jq '.prizes[] | select(any(.laureates[]?; .surname == "Ghez")) | {year: .year, prize: .category, name: (.laureates[] | select(.surname == "Ghez") | "\(.firstname) \(.surname)"), citation: (.laureates[] | select(.surname == "Ghez") | .motivation | sub("\""; ""; "g"))}' NobelPrizes.json
# {
#  "year": "2020",
#  "prize": "physics",
#  "name": "Andrea Ghez",
#  "citation": "for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy"
#}
```
