# PBS 158+ jq TO DO

## Select-like Functions

Like `select` these functions either pass or don't pass the input to the output based on a criteria, but unlike with `select`, the criteria is pre-defined, so they don't take any arguments. These are intended as *'does exactly what it says on the tin'* functions ðŸ˜‰

It's easier to show what these functions do with code snippets than to try describe them, and to help us do that we'll use the file `sampleData.json` which contains a top-level array containing entries of different data types:

```json
[
  null,
  true,
  -1,
  0,
  11,
  3.1415,
  "42",
  "waffles",
  [],
  ["dogs", "cats"],
  {},
  {"apples": 12, "pears": 3}
]
```



```bash
# select all nulls (only really useful if you want to check if there are any or count them)
jq '.[] | nulls' sampleData.json
# null

# select everything that's not null
jq '.[] | values' sampleData.json
# true
# -1
# 0
# 11
# 3.1415
# "42"
# "waffles"
# []
# [
#   "dogs",
#   "cats"
# ]
# {}
# {
#   "apples": 12,
#   "pears": 3
# }

# select all booleans
jq '.[] | booleans' sampleData.json
# true

# select all numbers
jq '.[] | numbers' sampleData.json
# -1
# 0
# 11
# 3.1415
# Note: the string "42" is not selected because strict types are used

# select all strings
jq '.[] | strings' sampleData.json
# "42"
# "waffles"

# select all arrays
jq '.[] | arrays' sampleData.json
# []
# [
#   "dogs",
#   "cats"
# ]
# Note: the empty array gets returned

# select all dictionaries
jq '.[] | objects' sampleData.json
# {}
# {
#   "apples": 12,
#   "pears": 3
# }
# Note: the empty dictionary gets returned

# select all things you can loop over (arrays or dictionaries)
jq '.[] | iterables' sampleData.json
# []
# [
#   "dogs",
#   "cats"
# ]
# {}
# {
#   "apples": 12,
#   "pears": 3
# }

# select everything that's a single value (i.e. that you can't loop over)
jq '.[] | scalars' sampleData.json
# null
# true
# -1
# 0
# 11
# 3.1415
# "42"
# "waffles"
```

## Sorting & Deduplication

### Sorting

### Deduplication

## Constructing new Outputs

### String Interpolation

Build a string describing Andrea Ghez's prize:

```bash
jq '.prizes[] | .laureates[]? | select(.surname == "Ghez") | "\(.firstname) \(.surname) was awarded her prize for \(.motivation)"' NobelPrizes.json --raw-output
# Andrea Ghez was awarded her prize for "for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy"
```

### Array Construction



### Dictionary Construction

Get the details of Dr. Andrea Ghez's Nobel prize as a new dictionary:

```bash
# Basic example â€” just extract top-level values
jq '.prizes[] | select(any(.laureates[]?; .surname == "Ghez")) | {year: .year, prize: .category}' NobelPrizes.json
# {
#  "year": "2020",
#  "prize": "physics"
# }

# Complex example â€” combine top-level and lower-level data, use string interpolation, and use string substitution
jq '.prizes[] | select(any(.laureates[]?; .surname == "Ghez")) | {year: .year, prize: .category, name: (.laureates[] | select(.surname == "Ghez") | "\(.firstname) \(.surname)"), citation: (.laureates[] | select(.surname == "Ghez") | .motivation | sub("\""; ""; "g"))}' NobelPrizes.json
# {
#  "year": "2020",
#  "prize": "physics",
#  "name": "Andrea Ghez",
#  "citation": "for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy"
#}
```
