# Instalment 172 of X — Git Submodules

We're making a quick detour back to Git to have a look at one of the more advanced topcis we initially intentionally skipped over, but now need to familiarise ourselves with.

When we first met Git I made a point of explaining that Git is late to the version control party, and as such, it had the benefit of learning from all its predecessors mistakes. This is why Git was designed to support nested repositories. You can map a folder in one git repo to another git repo. This allows for great flexibility when breaking up large codebases, and, when deploying complex systems into production.

We're used to thinking of Git as a tool for programmes, but it is also a tool for sysadmins, allowing for easy managment of live websites and web apps.
