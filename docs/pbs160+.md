## PBS 160 of X — jq: Transforming Data

TO DO

1. Pretty-printing JSON
2. Searching JSON
3. Transforming JSON

We covered pretty printing right at the start of this mini series, and we've spent the rest of our time learning how to filter down the input JSON to just the information we are interested in, now it's time to start  making better use of that filtered information by transforming it into the form we want. Those transformations can be thought of as taking two distinct forms — altering existing values by applying some kind of rule to them, and assembling the information into new data structures that fit our needs.

The jq language offers a wonderfully wide array of functions and operators for altering existing data, but we're going to start our exploration of jq data transformation by looking at jq's syntax for building new data structures, specifically assembling strings, building arrays, and building dictionaries.

## Mathematical Operators & Functions

Let's start nice and simple, the jq language supports the usual suspects in terms of mathematical operators:

| Operator | Description        | Example                      |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition           | `jq -n '1 + 1'` produces `2` |
| `-`      | Subtraction        | `jq -n '3 - 1'` produces `2` |
| `*`      | Multiplication     | `jq -n '2 * 1'` produces `2` |
| `/`      | Division           | `jq -n '4 / 2'` produces `2` |
| `%`      | Modulo (remainder) | `jq -n '5 % 3'` produces `2` |

Note the use of the `-n` flag in the examples to tell the `jq` command not to expect any input to process.

Something to notice is that the jq language does not support the increment and decrement operators `++` and `--`.

As well as these operators, the jq language also provides built in functions for performing arithemtic.

To make the examples shorter to write and easier to interpret we'll use a pair of JSON files from the instalment ZIP in our examples. First, we'll use `numbers.json` which contains a single top-level array of numbers:

```json
[
	-42,
	0,
	3.1415,
	11
]
```

And we'll also use `menu.json` which contains a top-level array of dictionaries, each contianing keys that are numeric:

```json
[
	{
		"name": "hotdogs",
		"price": 5.99,
		"stock": 143
	},
	{
		"name": "pancakes",
		"price": 3.10,
		"stock": 43
	},
	{
		"name": "waffles",
		"price": 7.50,
		"stock": 14
	}
]
```

Note that some of these functions can tolerate having non-numbers sent to them, but many will throw errors for at least some non-numeric data types, so to be safe, only send numbers through these functions. Another thing to watch out for is that even when non-numeric values don't cause errors they can produce unexpected results, e.g. the absolute value of a string represatation of a negative number is the same string, un-changed — `jq -n '"-9.999" | abs'` outputs `"-9.999"`.

| jq Function         | Description                                                  | Example                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `abs`               | Outputs the absolute value of the input.                     | `jq .[]|abs` outputs`42`, `0`, `3.1415` & `11`               |
| `floor`             | Rounds input decimal numbers down to the integer part.       | `jq -n '3.1415 | floor'` outputs `3`, and `jq -n '9.999 | floor'` outputs `9` |
| `sqrt`              | Outputs the square root of the input.                        |                                                              |
| `min`               | Outputs the minimum value from an input array of numbers.    | `jq '. | min' numbers.json` outputs `-42`                    |
| `max`               | Outputs the maximum value from an input array of numbers.    | `jq '. | max' numbers.json` outputs `11`                     |
| `min_by(.KEY_PATH)` | Outputs the dictionary in an input array of dictionaries that has the minimum value for a given key. | `jq -c '. | min_by(.stock)' menu.json` outputs `{"name":"waffles","price":7.50,"stock":14}` |
| `max_by(.KEY_PATH)` | Outputs the dictionary in an inpuit array of dictionaries that has the maximum value for a given key. | `jq -c '. | max_by(.price)' menu.json` outputs `{"name":"waffles","price":7.50,"stock":14}` |

Those are the arithmetic functions provided by the jq language itself, but the `jq` command has a mathematical trick up its sleeve! All the standard 1, 2 & 3 argument C arithmetic functiuons from C's standard math library can be used in jq. 

For reason's I can't quite fathom the way in which one-argument C functions and two or three argument C functions get mapped to jq are not consistent. For one-argument C functions the input to the jq function gets passed as the C function's argument. But, for two and three argument C functions all arguments need to be specified in jq.

The exact functions available will depend on the version of the C libaries installed on the computer, but some widely available useful ones of note are:

| C Maths Function | Description                                                  | Example                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ceil`           | Round an input decimal number up to the nearest integer. An obvious companion for jq's built-in `floor` and C's `round` functions. | `jq -n '3.1415 | ceil'` outputs `4`, and `jq -n '9.999 | ceil'` outputs `10` |
| `round`          | Round an input decimal number up or down to the nearest integer. An obvious companion for jq's built-in `floor` and C's `ceil` functions. | `jq -n '3.1415 | round'` outputs `3`, and `jq -n '9.999 | round'` outputs `10` |
| `pow`            | Raise an input number to the power passed as the first argument. | `jq -n '2 | pow(.; 3)'` outputs `8`                          |

## Transforming Strings

As well as allowing us to transform numbers, the jq languages provides many mechanisms for transforming strings.

### 'Adding', 'Multipling' & 'dividing' Strings (Operator Overloading)

The jq language has, to use programming jargon *overloaded* some of it's operators, including the addition (`+`) operator. Overloaded operators do different things when presented with different types of data to operate on. Many programming languages use overloading, and while we may not have called it out by name when we expored JavaScript, we did see operator overloading when we used `+` both for arithmetic addition, and for string concatenation.

Note that the jq language's support of operator overloading is basic compared to what we saw with JavaScript. JavaScript's operator overloading can handle different data types on each side of the operator, and them automatically *casts* (i.e. converts) one of the two to match the other before applying the appropriate action. This requires complex rules for determining what to do for every possible combination of types. In jq things are much simpler — with just a few specific exceptions, **the types on each side of the overloaded operators must match**! 

Bringing this back to strings, like in JavaScript, jq's `+` operator is overloaded for both arithmentic addition and string concatenation  i.e. when both inputs are numbers they get added, and when both are strings they get concatenated:

```sh
# two numbers - arithmetic addition (as above)
jq -n '22 + 20' # oputputs 42

# two strings - concatenation
jq -n '"a string" + " another string"' # oputputs "a string another string"

# mismatched types
jq -n '"a string" + 42' # throws an error
```

As we'll learn later, the `+` operator is even more overloaded than this, it can also handle arrays and dictionaries!

The multiplication operator (`*`) is also overloaded, and it is one of those where a specific mis-match of types is explicitly supported — you can multiply a string by a number to concatenate it with itself that many times, in other words, to repeat it that many times:

```sh
jq -n '"Ho" * 3' # outputs "HoHoHo"
```

Finally, the division operator `/` has been overloaded to work with two strings — when a string is divided by another string, the string to the left is split on the string to the right, and an array is returned. In other words, **string division with `/` is an shortcut for the `split` function**.

```sh
jq -nc '"10:20:30" / ":"' # outputs ["10","20","30"]
```

### Built-in String Functions

The jq language provides a selection of built-in functions for manipulating strings, some of the more useful ones are listed below:

| Function         | Description                                                  | Example                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ascii_downcase` | Convert an input string to lower case.                       | `jq -n '"Somethin" | ascii_downcase'` outputs `"something"`  |
| `ascii_upcase`   | Convert an input string to upper case.                       | `jq -n '"Something" |ascii_upcase'` outputs `"SOMETHING"`    |
| `ltrimstr`       | Remove a given prefix from an input string, or return the string un-changed if the prefix is not present. | `jq -n '"DEBUG: something" | ltrimstr("DEBUG: ")'` outputs `"something"` |
| `rtrimstr`       | Remove a given postfix from an input string, or return the string un-changed if the postfix is not present. | `jq -n '"something (DEBUG)" | rtrimstr(" (DEBUG)")'` outputs `"something"` |
| `sub`            | Perform string substitution on an input string to produce the output string. A regular expression should be passed as the first argument, a replacement as the second, and optionally regular expression flags as a third. | `jq -n '"2023-11-12: Something" | sub("[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}: "; "")'` outputs `"Something"`, i.e. replaces a leading timestamp with an empty string. |

## Altering Arrays

Now that we've seen how to alter strings, let's take a look at way of transforming arrays.

### Re-Ordering Arrays (`sort` & `reverse`)

Let's start with the simplest type of array transformation — re-orderings.

The simplest re-ordering is a straight forward reversing, and jq provides just that with the `reverse` function:

```sh
jq -nc '[1, 2, 3] | reverse' # outputs [3,2,1]
```

Then of course we have array sorting.

When you have an array with simple values the built-in `sort` function will generally do what you want.

The function requires an array as input, and it will first group elements by type, starting with any `null` elements, then any booleans, then numbers, then strings, then arrays, and finally dictionaries. Within each grouping it will then perform the most sensible sorting, `false` before `true` for Booleans, numeric sorting for numbers, and alphabetic (lexical) sorting for strings. (Note that the rules for sorting arrays and dictionaries exist, but are out of the scope of this series).

Let's see the `sort` function in action:

```sh
# numbers
jq -nc '[1, 4, 3] | sort' # outputs [1,3,4]

# strings
jq -nc '["popcorn", "waffles",  "pancakes"] | sort' 
# outputs ["pancakes","popcorn","waffles"]

# mixed types
jq -nc '[42, true, 11, "waffles", false,  "pancakes"] | sort'
# outputs [false,true,11,42,"pancakes","waffles"]
```

When dealing with arrays containing more complicated elements like other arrays or dictionaries, you probably want to specify your own rule for sorting, you can do this with th `sort_by` function. It takes as an argument a filter, and that filter will be applied to each array element, and the elements will be sorted based on the results of applying the filter. Usually the filter is simply a dictionary key.

For example, we can re-order our menu (from the `menu.js` file in the instalment ZIP), with:

```sh
jq 'sort_by(.price)' menu.json
```

This outputs:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "pancakes",
    "price": 3.10,
    "stock": 43
  },
  {
    "name": "hotdogs",
    "price": 5.99,
    "stock": 143
  },
  {
    "name": "waffles",
    "price": 7.50,
    "stock": 14
  }
]
```

As you can see, the array is now sorted by price.

### Adding and Removing Elements with the  `+` & `-` Operators

As mentioned earlier, the `+` operator has been overloaded to perform a useful action when both inputs are arrays — it merges them into a new bigger array:

```sh
# Note: -n for no input & -c for compact output
jq -nc '[1, 2] + [3, 4]' # outputs [1,2,3,4]
```

While the `-` operator is not overloaded for strings, it is overloaded for arrays, and can be used create a new array with elements removed. The array to the left of the `-` is treated as the original array, and the elements in the array to the right of the `-` are removed from the original array, if present, to create the output array.

```sh
jq -nc '[1, 2, 3, 4] - [4, 5]' # outputs [1,2,3]
```

### Array Deduplication

When you start adding arrays together it's easy to end up with duplucates that you may well not want. The jq language provides two useful functions for removing them.

Firstly, the simple `unique` function returns the input array sorted with any duplicated elements removed. The input must be an array. For exmaple:

```sh
jq -nc '[4, 1, 4, 3, 2] | unique' # outputs [1,2,3,4]
```

If you need a more complex definition of 'uniqueness' you can use the `unique_by` function to supply your own filter as an argument. The output array will only contain one element which the filter evaluates to a given value. If multiple elements evaluate to the same value, one will be kept, but there's no guarantee as to which one it will be. Also note that the elements in the output array will be sorted based on the result of the filter.

As a somewhat contrived example, we can make our menu (from `menu.json` above) unique by length of name. Before we do, let's compute the lengths see what results we expect, we can do that with:

```sh
jq '.[] | .name | length' menu.json
```

This shows that hotdogs and waffles have 7 letters, and pancakes 8. We would expect to always get pancakes in our answer, but only one of waffles or hotdogs when we make the menu unique by name. Let's try:

```sh
jq 'unique_by(.name | length)' menu.json
```

This gives us the output:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "hotdogs",
    "price": 5.99,
    "stock": 143
  },
  {
    "name": "pancakes",
    "price": 3.10,
    "stock": 43
  }
]
```

As expected, we get one item with a name of length 7, the one with a name of length 8, because the items are sorted on the result of the filter as well as deduplicated based on it.

### Flattening Nested Arrays

When assembling an array from multiple sources you may end up with an array of arrays when you actually wanted a single unified array. This is where the built-in `flatten` function comes in.

The `flatten` function takes an array as in input, and if it contains other arrays, it replaces them with their entries in the output array. The funtion applies this logic recursively, so you if your array contains arrays which contain arrays, it will still flatten them all out to a single array of all the values.

```sh
jq -nc '[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]] | flatten'
# outputs [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

By default the flatten function will keep recursing down into all nested arrays, but you can pass an optional argument to limit how deep it goes. To see what this means, let's repeat our above example with limits of 2 and 1:

```sh
# limit to a depth of 2
# arrays in the input array, and arrays in arrays in the input array
jq -nc '[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]] | flatten(2)'
# outputs [1,2,3,4,5,6]

# limit to a depth of 1
# arrays in the input array only
jq -nc '[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]] | flatten(1)'
# outputs [1,2,3,4,[5,6]]
```

### The `map` Function

After `select`, the most powerful function in `jq` is probably `map`. It takes an array as an input, and a filter as an argument, and it returns a new array containing the result of applying the filter to each element of the input array. In effect, it lets you **loop over an aray in a single function call**, and **process each element without exploding the array**.

Fo example, we can convert all the numbers in an array to their absolute values with:

```sh
jq -nc '[1, -2, 3, -42] | map(. | abs)'
# outputs [1,2,3,42]
```

Note that, like with the `select` function, the special `.` symbol means *'the current value being processed'*. That means that when processing the first element in the input array in the example above `.` is `1`, then it's `-2`, and so on.

## Dictionary Manipulation

### Adding and Removing Keys

As mentioned earlier, the `+` operators is overloaded for handling dicrtionaries. When two dictionaries are added together, a new dictionary is created containing the keys and values from both. If both input dictionaries define a value for the same key, the value from the dictionary on the right of the `+` operator is used.

If the dictionaries contain dictionaries, a recursive merge can be done by using the `*` operator instead of the `+` operator.

You might imagine key could comehow be removed with an overloaded subtraction operator, but alas not, we need to use the built-in `del` function for that. This function requires a dictionary as the input, and a key path as an argument. For example, we could remove the stock key from each item in our menu (`menu.js` from the instalment ZIP) with:

```sh
jq '.[] | del(.stock)' menu.json
```

Which returns:

```json
{
  "name": "hotdogs",
  "price": 5.99
}
{
  "name": "pancakes",
  "price": 3.10
}
{
  "name": "waffles",
  "price": 7.50
}
```

Note we expoloded the array in this example, so we now have a list of separate output values instead of a single array. We can combin the `del` function with the `map` function to avoid exploding the array:

```sh
jq 'map(del(.stock))' menu.json
```

This returns a single array containing the updated dictionaries:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "hotdogs",
    "price": 5.99
  },
  {
    "name": "pancakes",
    "price": 3.10
  },
  {
    "name": "waffles",
    "price": 7.50
  }
]
```
