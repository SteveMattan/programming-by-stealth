# PBS 152 of X — Bash: Functions & Scope

I've been in two minds as to whether or not to cover functions in shell scripting in this mini-series, but since the community is really getting serious about shell scripts, I've decided we should, and since they're important to any discussion on variable scopes, now is the perfect time to introduce them!

## PBS 151 Challenge Solution

The challenge set at the end of the previous instalment was to write a script to render multiplication tables in a nicely formatted table. The script was to take the number it should do the tables for as a required argument, default to rending the table from 1 to 10, and allow optional named arguments `-m` and `-M` for custom minimum and maximum values. There was also bonus credit for outputting the table through `less` if and only if the output was going to a terminal.

On reflection, I should not have been thinking *minimum* and *maximum*, but *start* and *end*, so I changed the spec for my sample solution to:

> Write a script that renders the multiplication tables for a given number. By default the table should start at 1 and run to 10. The script should:
>
> 1. Require one argument — the number to render the table for
> 2. Accept the following two optional arguments:
>  	* `-s` to specify a custom starting value, replacing the default of `1`
> 	    * `-e` to specify a custom ending value, replacing the default of `10`

Because I needed it to save my own sanity while trying to debug my sample solution, I also added an extra feature not in the requirements, a `-d` flag to enable debug output to `STDERR`.
