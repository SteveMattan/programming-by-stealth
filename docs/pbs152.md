# PBS 152 of X — Bash: xargs & Easier Arithmetic

While developing my sample solution to the challenge set at the end of the previous instalment I found myself running into three pain-points, and it so happens that addressing them in this instalment and the next fits in perfectly into the bigger arc of our shell scripting journey.

The two pain points we'll focus on today fell out of my simple desire to use the ASCII characters for drawing pretty tables to frame my table. To do that I needed to know the maximum length of each column, and doing that reliably required a lot of character counting and arithmetic.

To do the character counting efficiently, I needed to make use of an extremely useful terminal command that's simultaneously extremely simple, and extremely confusing! I've been dreading trying to explain it, but now is the time, prepare to meet `xargs`!

After that heavy lifting we'll move on to doing arithmetic in a cleaner and simpler way than piping strings through the `bc` (basic calculator) command.

The final pain point — copying and pasting code, that will be the main focus of the next instalement, POSIX functions, and, the very much related topic of variable scope in Bash.

## PBS 151 Challenge Solution

The challenge set at the end of the previous instalment was to write a script to render multiplication tables in a nicely formatted table. The script was to take the number it should do the tables for as a required argument, default to rending the table from 1 to 10, and allow optional named arguments `-m` and `-M` for custom minimum and maximum values. There was also bonus credit for outputting the table through `less` if and only if the output was going to a terminal.

On reflection, I should not have been thinking *minimum* and *maximum*, but *start* and *end*, so I changed the spec for my sample solution to:

> Write a script that renders the multiplication tables for a given number. By default the table should start at 1 and run to 10. The script should:
>
> 1. Require one argument — the number to render the table for
> 2. Accept the following two optional arguments:
>  	* `-s` to specify a custom starting value, replacing the default of `1`
> 	    * `-e` to specify a custom ending value, replacing the default of `10`

Because I needed it to save my own sanity while trying to debug my sample solution, I also added an extra feature not in the requirements, a `-d` flag to enable debug output to `STDERR`.
