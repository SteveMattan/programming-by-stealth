# About

Programming by Stealth is an ongoing collaborative project between [Bart Busschots](https://bartb.ie/) of [Bartificer Creations](https://bartificer.net/) and Allison Sheridan of the [NosillaCast Apple Podcast](https://podfeet.com). The idea is to sneak up on real programming in small easy steps, using the allure of the web as the carrot to entice people forward.

Each instalment consists of an article written by Bart and an accompanying episode of our Programming By Stealth Podcast where Bart and Allison cover the same material in a conversational form. Allison's role is to play the proverbial _everyperson_ and pepper Bart with questions to help clarify the material (and to produce the podcast.) You can subscribe to the [Programming By Stealth podcast](https://podfeet.com/ccatp/pbs-rss.xml) directly in your podcatcher of choice, or listen from the embedded player in each instalment.

The series is intended to be evergreen, but if you play along in real-time you can join the community in the [Podfeet Slack](https://podfeet.com/slack). The challenges set in the series are definitely more fun in real time.
