# PBS 154 of X ‚Äî Bash: Expansions & Brackets Redux

This final Bash instalment is mostly about putting things we already know into their proper context, but we will  learn a few new things we've skipped over too. None of these new things are vital to know, but they can be darn useful, and they'll get you instant nerd street-cred when a fellow scripter sees you using them üôÇ

## PBS 153 Challenge Solution

The challenge from the previous instalment was quite basic ‚Äî update your solution to the previous challenge to replace any duplicated code with functions.

In my previous solution there was just one obvious piece of repeated logic ‚Äî checks for whether or not something is an integer, resulting and many `if` statements starting:

```bash
if echo "$OPTARG" | egrep -q "$intRE"
```

I added a simple function definition to the top of my script:

```bash
# test if the first argument is an integer
# Arguments   : NONE
# STDIN       : value to test
# STDOUT      : NOTHING
# Return Codes:
#   0 - the value is an integer
#   1 - the value is not an integer
is_int () {
    echo "$1" | egrep -q '^[-]?\d+$' && return 0
    return 1
}
```

Which then allowed me to replace those `if` statements with simpler and clearer ones of the form:

```bash
if is_int $OPTARG
```

You'll find my full sample solution in the Instalment ZIP as `pbs153-challengeSolution.sh`.

## Command Grouping

Sometimes it's useful to run multiple commands as if they were one. Two common reasons are to have a different scope for a few commands, and to redirect streams for multiple commands at once.

When you decide you want to group commands, you have two choices:

1. Use `{ }` to run the grouped commands in the current shell, this means the commands share the same scope as the rest of the script.
2. Use `( )` to run the grouped commands in a sub-shell so they run in a copy of the script's scope, so any changes to variables don't affect the rest of the script.

As an example, this script (`pbs154a-noGrouping.sh` in the instalment) writes some output to `STDOUT`, and some to a log file:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

dessert=pancakes
echo "Dessert is $dessert"
echo "Initial dessert: $dessert">log.txt # start new file
dessert=waffles
echo "Updated dessert: $dessert">>log.txt # append
echo 'desert is tasty!'>>log.txt # append
echo "Dessert is now $dessert"
```

Notice that the first time we write the file we replace its content (`>`), then we append to it (`>>`).

Running the script and viewing the contents of the log file gives the following results:

```text
$ ./pbs154a-noGrouping.sh 
Dessert is pancakes
Dessert is now waffles
$ cat log.txt
Initial dessert: pancakes
Updated dessert: waffles
desert is tasty!
$ 
```

We can use command grouping to simpligy this script (`pbs154b-grouping.sh`):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

dessert=pancakes
echo "Dessert is $dessert"

# grouped commands
{
    echo "Initial dessert: $dessert" # no need to redirect!
    dessert=waffles
    echo "Updated dessert: $dessert" # no need to redirect!
    echo 'desert is tasty!' # no need to redirect!
}>log.txt # start new file

echo "Dessert is now $dessert"
```

Notice that in this example the `$dessert` variable inside and outside the group are in the same scope ‚Äî the change made in the group affects the code outside the group:

```text
$ ./pbs154b-grouping.sh 
Dessert is pancakes
Dessert is now waffles
$ cat log.txt
Initial dessert: pancakes
Updated dessert: waffles
desert is tasty!
$ 
```

If we change to grouping in a sub-shell then the commands inside the group see the initial value for `$dessert` from the code outside the group, but the change made is only seen inside the  group. We can see this in `pbs154c-subshell.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

dessert=pancakes
echo "Dessert is $dessert"

# grouped commands
(
    echo "Initial dessert: $dessert" # no need to redirect!
    dessert=waffles
    echo "Updated dessert: $dessert" # no need to redirect!
    echo 'desert is tasty!' # no need to redirect!
)>log.txt # start new file

echo "Dessert is still $dessert"
```

Running the script now shows the grouped commands can see the outer code's variables, but not alter them:

```text
$ ./pbs154c-subshell.sh 
Dessert is pancakes
Dessert is still pancakes
$ cat log.txt
Initial dessert: pancakes
Updated dessert: waffles
desert is tasty!
$ 
```

A very important point to note is that **the braces cannot be cuddled**, and **the closing brace must be a separate command**, i.e. it must be the start of a line, or, be separated from the last command in the group by a semicolon (`;`).

## Expansions in Bash

Throughout every instalment in this series-within-a-series, and throughout just about every instalment of Taming the Terminal we have been making use of shell expansions without explicitly calling attention to that fact.

When we pass arguments to terminal commands the values we type and the values received by the command are often not the same. The official name for these transformations are *Shell Expansions*.

If that sounds a but abstract, we can use the `echo` command to illustrate the point ‚Äî `echo` simply prints out the value of its arguments, so if there were no shell expansions, `echo` would print back exactly what we type in, but of course we know it does not, as illustrated by this little sequence:

```text
$ echo ~
/Users/bartbusschots
$ echo 'Hello World'
Hello World
$ echo $PWD
/Users/bartbusschots
$
```

[Bash's official documentation lists seven distinct expansions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Expansions.html), and mentions that when all the expansions are done it performs another transformation (that for some reason is not referred to as an expansion) ‚Äî quote removal. It also lists the order in which all these transformations get applied:

| Expansion                                                    | Description                                                  | Result                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| [Brace Expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html) | Basic sequence generation, e.g. `doc{1..3}.txt` ‚Üí `doc1.txt doc2.txt doc3.txt` | String                    |
| [Tilde Expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Tilde-Expansion.html) | Home directory path lookups (and more), e.g. `~/Documents` ‚Üí `/Users/bartbusschots/Documents` | File path                 |
| [Shell Parameter Expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html) | Shell variable value lookups, e.g. `I am $USER` or `I am ${USER}`  ‚Üí  `I am bart`. Also works with arrays, given `a=(a b c)`; `${a[#]` ‚Üí `3`, `${a[@]}` ‚Üí `a b c` & `${a[0]}` ‚Üí `a` | String or List of strings |
| [Command Substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html) | Substitute the result (`STDOUT`) of executing a command ‚Äî e.g. `today is $(date +%A)` ‚Üí `today is Wednesday` | String                    |
| [Arithmetic Expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Arithmetic-Expansion.html) | Perform a numeric calculation and use the result, e.g. `doc$(( 4 + 5 )).txt` ‚Üí `doc9.txt` | Number as String          |
| [Word Splitting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Word-Splitting.html) | The results of any parameter expansions, command substitutions, or arithmetic expansions **that were not quoted** get split on `$IFS` (blank space by default). | Parameter list            |
| [Filename Expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Filename-Expansion.html) | Patern-based path lookups, only paths that exist are included | Paths as parameter list   |
| [Quote Removal](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Quote-Removal.html) | Quotes surrounding parameters get removed                    | The final parameter list  |

We're not going to go into detail on all of these, but I do want to draw your attention to some, and highlight some nice little power features I've not found an excuse to mention before.

### Brace Expansion

When you need it, brace expansion is very powerful, but you very rarely see it used.

Brace expansion explodes one argumenmt into many by repeating part of it over a range of values. You define an optional prefix, a range enclosed in curly braces, and an optional postfix. The range can be letters or numbers, and the start and end are separated by two periods.

**Note** ‚Äî the prefix, the range, and the postfix **must** be cuddled to the curly brackets!

As an example, the following command will create three blank text files named `doc1.txt`, `doc2.txt`, and `doc3.txt`:

```bash
touch doc{1..3}.txt
```

### Tilda Expansion

While it has some advanced features we'll be ignoring, the primary use of `~` expansions is to find the paths to users home directories. The `~` character followed by a username gets expanded into the path to that user's home directory, if you leave out the username it defaults to *the current user* (i.e. `$USER`). If the user doesn't exist, or the user doesn't have a home dir, the text is left un-changed:

```text
$ echo ~
/Users/bartbusschots
$ echo ~poop
~poop
$
```

### Shell Parameter Expansion and Arrays

At its most basic level shell parameter expansion just replaces a variable's name with its value, but when you expand an array something a little more interesting happens ‚Äî each time the expansion meets another array element it splits the result into a new argument (or *word* in Bash jargon). Consider the following array:

```bash
arr=(one 2 iii)
```

Now, let's expand it as the arguments to a loop that prints each entry on a new line pre-fixed with a star by running `for i in "pre${arr[@]}post"; do echo "* $i"; done`:

```text
$ for i in "pre${arr[@]}post"; do echo "* $i"; done
* preone
* 2
* iiipost
$ 
```

Notice that starting the array expansion did not start a new argument, but the boundary between the first and second element did, as did that boundary between the second and third, and again, the end if the array also didn't start a new argument.

### Word Splitting

When Bash finishes replacing any variables with their values (parameter expansion), any embedded commands with their outputs (command expansion), and any arithmetic expansions with their results, those outputs get split into separate arguments (or *words* to use the documentation's vocabulary). The default separator is white space, i.e. spaces, tabs, and newline characters, but if you want the splitting to happen on another delimiter you can specify one by setting the value of `$IFS`.  **Word splitting is not performed within double-quoted strings**!

Consider the following string variable:

```bash
s='a string with spaces'
```

If we loop over that string without quoting its expansion, the loop will run once for each word in the string, because word splitting will happen after the variable's value is expanded. We can see this by using a loop to print all the arguments it sees on a separate line pre-fixed with a star  with `for i in $s; do echo "* $i"; done`:

```text
$ for i in $s; do echo "* $i"; done
* a
* string
* with
* spaces
$ 
```

If we run the same loop by quote the string with `for i in "$s"; do echo "* $i"; done` we see that no word splitting happens:

```text
$ for i in "$s"; do echo "* $i"; done
* a string with spaces
$ 
```

The same logic explains the behaviour or arrays depending on whether or not you quote their expansion. Consider the following array:

```bash
a=('string one with space' string2)
```

If we loop over that array and print each word the loop sees on a separate line with a bullet before it without quoting the variable expansion, i.e. by looping over `${a[@]}` we see that word splitting happens:

```text
$ for i in ${a[@]}; do echo "* $i"; done
* string
* one
* with
* space
* string2
$
```

But if we do the same thing but with the array expansion quoted (`"${a[@]}"`), we see word splitting is skipped for the elements in the array:

```text
$ for i in "${a[@]}"; do echo "* $i"; done
* string one with space
* string2
$ 
```

Notice that the splitting of the array itself is not affected by word splitting, that splitting is part of the parameter expansion itself.

## Quick Reference/Redux ‚Äî An Ocean Brackets Summarised

One of the most confusing things to keep straight in your head when coding in Bash is the meanings of all the different kinds of brackets, so here's a quick refresher on what we've learned. Hopefully this concise list will prove a useful quick-reference going forward.

|       Brackets        | Description                                                  | Special Rules                                                | Result        |
| :-------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
|         `[ ]`         | **Legacy tests** ‚Äî included in Bash for backwards compatibility with SH, **do not use** |                                                              |               |
|        `[[ ]]`        | **Tests** ‚Äî evaluate a boolean expression to an exit code. Primarily used in `if` statements, e.g. `if [[ $n -eq 4 ]]; then echo 'FOUR!'; fi` | Variables do not need to be quoted                           | Exit code     |
|        `${ }`         | **Variable expansion** ‚Äî fetch the value of a variable. The braces can be omitted when the variable is not an array and the variable name has no special characters. E.g. `echo "I am ${User}"` or `echo "I am $User"` |                                                              | String        |
|         `$()`         | **Sub-shell Expansion** ‚Äî execute commands in a sub-shell and substitute with text from `STDOUT`. E.g. `echo "It's now $(date)"` |                                                              | String        |
|       `$(( ))`        | **Arithmetic Expansion** ‚Äî perform calculation and substitute the result, e.g. `echo "1 + 1 = $(( 1 + 1 ))"` | Automatic variable expansion ‚Äî use `x` instead of `${x}` or `$x` | String        |
|    `{}` (cuddled)     | **Rage Expansion** ‚Äî explode an optional prefix, a range, and an optional postfix into separate arguments, e.g. `f{1..3}.zip` ‚Üí `f1.zip`, `f2.zip` & `f3.zip` | The parts of the expansion **must** be cuddled               | Argument List |
| `{ ; }` (not cuddled) | **Command Grouping** ‚Äî combine multiple commands into one without creating a sub-shell | The content **must not be cuddled** to the braces, and the closing brace must be separate | Exit code     |
|         `( )`         | **Sub-shell Command Grouping** ‚Äî combine multiple commands in a sub-shell |                                                              | Exit code     |
|         `=()`         | **Array Declaration** ‚Äî declare an array. Note that the `=` **must** be cuddled to the opening parenthesis and the array name. E.g. `myArray=(waffles pancakes pizza)` |                                                              | Array         |

## The Official Bash Docs

You may have noticed that for most of this series-within-a-series I've pushed the official docs much less frequently than I usually do. This is because I feared they may confuse more than help. In my opinion the docs are organised in such a way that they only make sense if you already know enough Bash to think in a bash-like way, so they're a useful reference for existing Bash users, but are likely to frustrate more than help a Bash newbie.

Throughout this series I've been careful to use the same wording the docs do, so now, as we arrive at the end of our Bash journey, it's time to bookmark those docs!
