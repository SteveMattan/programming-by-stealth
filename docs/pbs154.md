# PBS 154 of X â€” Bash: Expansions & Brackets Redux

This final Bash instalment is mostly about putting things we already know into their proper context, but we will  learn a few new things we've skipped over too. None of these new things are vital to know, but they can be darn useful, and they'll get you instant nerd street-cred when a fellow scripter sees you using them ðŸ™‚

## PBS 153 Challenge Solution

The challenge from the previous instalment was quite basic â€” update your solution to the previous challenge to replace any duplicated code with functions.

In my previous solution there was just one obvious piece of repeated logic â€” checks for whether or not something is an integer, resulting and many `if` statements starting:

```bash
if echo "$OPTARG" | egrep -q "$intRE"
```

I added a simple function definition to the top of my script:

```bash
# test if the first argument is an integer
# Arguments   : NONE
# STDIN       : value to test
# STDOUT      : NOTHING
# Return Codes:
#   0 - the value is an integer
#   1 - the value is not an integer
is_int () {
    echo "$1" | egrep -q '^[-]?\d+$' && return 0
    return 1
}
```

Which then allowed me to replace those `if` statements with simpler and clearer ones of the form:

```bash
if is_int $OPTARG
```

You'll find my full sample solution in the Instalment ZIP as `pbs153-challengeSolution.sh`.

## Expansions in Bash

Throughout every instalment in this series-within-a-series, and throughout just about every instalment of Taming the Terminal we have been making use of shell expansions without explicitly calling attention to that fact.

When we pass arguments to terminal commands the values we type and the values received by the command are often not the same. The official name for these transformations are *Shell Expansions*.

If that sounds a but abstract, we can use the `echo` command to illustrate the point â€” `echo` simply prints out the value of its arguments, so if there were no shell expansions, `echo` would print back exactly what we type in, but of course we know it does not, as illustrated by this little sequence:

```text
$ echo ~
/Users/bartbusschots
$ echo 'Hello World'
Hello World
$ echo $PWD
/Users/bartbusschots
$
```

[Bash's official documentation lists seven distinct expansions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Expansions.html), and mentions that when all the expansions are done it performs another transformation (that for some reason is not referred to as an expansion) â€” quote removal. It also lists the order in which all these transformations get applied:

1. [Brace Expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html) â€” basic sequence generation, e.g. `doc{1..3}.txt` â†’ `doc1.txt doc2.txt doc3.txt` (new!)
2. [Tilde Expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Tilde-Expansion.html) â€” home directory path insertion, e.g. `~/Documents` â†’ `/Users/bartbusschots/Documents`
3. [Shell Parameter Expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html) â€” insert the values of variables, e.g. `I am $USER` or `I am ${USER}`  â†’  `I am bart`
4. [Command Substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html) â€” e.g. `today is $(date +%A)` â†’ `today is Wednesday`
5. [Arithmetic Expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Arithmetic-Expansion.html) â€” arithmetic expressions that return values rather than success codes, e.g. `doc$(( 4 + 5 )).txt` â†’ `doc9.txt`
6. [Word Splitting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Word-Splitting.html) â€” the result of any previously executed expansions gets split into separate arguments, or *words* based on the value of `$IFS`, unless they have been quoted
7. [Filename Expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Filename-Expansion.html) â€” wild-card file paths, e.g. `*.txt` â†’ `a.txt`  & `another.txt`
8. [Quote Removal](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Quote-Removal.html) â€” any quoted arguments get their surrounding quotes removed before the value gets handed to the command

We're not going to go into detail on all of these, but I do want to draw your attention to some, and highlight some nice little power features I've not found an excuse to mention before.

## Quick Reference/Redux â€” An Ocean Brackets Summarised

One of the most confusing things to keep straight in your head when coding in Bash is the meanings of all the different kinds of brackets, so here's a quick refresher on what we've learned. Hopefully this concise list will prove a useful quick-reference going forward.

| Brackets | Description                                                  | Special Rules                               | Example               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `[ ]`    | **Legacy tests** â€” **DO NOT USE**                            |                                             |                       |
| `[[ ]]`  | **Tests** â€” primarily used with conditionals, uses boolean operators to generate an exit code | Variables do not need to be quoted in tests | `if [[ $n -eq 4 ]]`   |
| `${ }`   | **Variable expansion** â€” use to fetch the value of a variable. Braces can be omitted when the variable is not an array, and when the variable name has no special characters |                                             | `echo "I am ${User}"` |
| `$()`    | **Sub-shell Expansion** â€” execute the contained commands in a sub-shell and replace what ever contained commands write to `STDOUT` |                                             |                       |
|          |                                                              |                                             |                       |
|          |                                                              |                                             |                       |
|          |                                                              |                                             |                       |
|          |                                                              |                                             |                       |
|          |                                                              |                                             |                       |
