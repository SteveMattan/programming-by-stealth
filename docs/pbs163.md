## 'Types' of Dictionary

Dictionaries are very flexible data structures, they can be used to achieve many different ends. This is why computer scientists use conceptual terms like 'record' and 'lookup' to describe different ways dictionaries are used to reprsent data. These are not rigorously defined terms, but loose concepts. For our purposes I want to describe two of those broad concepts — records and lookups.

### Records

Consiser our the `menu.json` file we've used for many of our examples in recent instalments:

TO DO - add file

This file contains and array of dictionaries, each defining the same keys. This JSON perfectly describes a traditional table with the keys defining the columns, and each dictionary, a row in the table, or a *'record'*.

In other words, arrays of dictionaries with the same keys can be thought of as records in a traditional database table or rows in a spreadsheet.

To illustrste the point, here's the table the file represents:

TO DO — add table

So, when the values of the keys in a dictionary map to the columns in a conceptual table we call those dictionaries *records*.

### The Space/Time Tradeoff

Arrays of record-style dictionaries are the least space-inefficient means of storing tabular data in JSON, so you'll see them a lot. But, they're very inefficient to search. The only way to find the details in a specific record is to loop over the array of dictionaries. In more traditional programming languages we literally use looping constructs like `for`, `while`, or `foreach`, but in jq we effectively do the same in less ways by exploding arrays and piping the pieces through the `select` function.

When you have small data sets you query just once this inefficiency is negligible, but for larger data sets searched often things go downhill fast, both in terms of processing time and code complexity. Lots of loops or lots of calls to `select` make for difficult to maintain code!

Is there a way to speed up the processing? Of course there is, but it will come with trade offs — we're inevitably forced to use space to buy time! We can use the space in RAM or on disk, but something always has to give!

In the world of databases, you trade space for time by adding little mini-tables to your tables called *indexes* which map column values to row numbers, so you can use and index on, say the `name` column to near instantly look up the row number for the record with the name `hotdog`. Indexes take time to build and update, and disk space to store, so you trade cpu time to manage the index each time you add or update a record, and disk space to store the index, in exchange for saving CPU time each time you need to search the table.

when you're working with JSON data there are no tables or indexes, just arrays and dictionaries, so you need to build index-like data structure from those pieces, and that's where lookup-type dictionaries come in.

### Lookups

A lookup is a dictionary where the keys are the values for the hypothetical column being indexed. In other words, instead of the keys being column headings like `name` and `price` as they are with record-style dictionaries, they are actual names or prices like `hotdog` and `TO DO`.

If your keys are now values for a given column, what are your values? They can either be record-style dictionaries, plain values, or arrays of values. Like there is no single right way to index a database table, there is no single right way to create JSON lookups — it varies each time by the nature of the data being stored, and kinds of queries you need to perform against it. Designing efficient data structures, be that database tables and indexes or JSON, is a skill, and the only way to learn is to make 10,000 mistakes!

My approach is to leave the structure of the JSON data I receive as-is unless and until I find myself thinking *"this is really hard to search"*, then I think about how to build one or more lookups to splify things.

TO DO — at least three examples - lookup of records, lookup by name, and lookup by price


## How jq Approaches Lookups 

Before describing the approach the creators of jq took, I want you to put yourself in their shoes. The problem to be solved is to design a standard jq function that can transform any of the infinity of possible JSON data structures into any of the infinitly many possible lookups. That's quite the complex problem!

Faced with these kinds of complex problems, there are a number of possible avenues open to developers.

One approach is to build a function that takes many possible optional arguments, or, build a large suite of functions, and hope you capture at least most of the possible scenarios most developers will face most of the time. This is how we got the massively complex `find` terminal command which tried to provide an optional argument for most types of searches most users need most of the time. One look at the `man` page for this command makes the trade off with this approach pretty obvious — so much complexity most users just give up! Thankfully this is not the approach the jq developers took.

Another common approach is to invent or adopt a domain-specific language, your functions take just a few arguments, one of which is a string that lets the user express their need in the appropriate domain-specific language. A good example here is the complex problem of pattern matching, where many programming/scripting languages choose to adopt the domain-specific language of regular expressions to simplify their own functions. This is in fact how the jq developers choose to tackle the complex problem of supporting pattern matching — provide a few simple jq functions that expect PCRE-formatted regular expressions as arguments. This is not how they chose to handle the lookup problem though, and with very good reason — there is no equivalent widely used domain-specific language for describing mappings between data structures and lookups.

The commonly used approach the jq developers did choose is to use a simple, well defined *intermediate data format*. Instead of one or more complex functions that go straight from any possible JSON input to any possible lookup, make users transform the JSON into a simple and clearly defined data structure first, and then pipe that to a very simple jq function. This is a great solution for jq, because transforming JSON is what jq is all about!

### jq 'Entries'

The intermediate format jq's lookup-related functions use is a simple array of dictionaries, which the documentation describe as *entries*. A list of *entries* is an array of dictionaries containing exactly two keys — one named `key`, and one named `value`, each describing one key-value pair, or entry, in a lookup.
