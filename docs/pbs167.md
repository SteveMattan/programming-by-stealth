## PBS 166 Challenge Solution

The final js challenge in this series-within-a-series was to use the `map`, `map_values`, and `reduce` functions we learned about in [the previous instalment](./pbs166) to refactor and enrich a domain data breach report from the wonderful [Have-I-Been-Pwnd](https://haveibeenpwned.com) service (HIBP) in two ways:

1. Remove the top-level `.Breaches` and `.Pastes` keys, and have the contents of the `.Breaches` lookup table become the top-level element. 
2. Use `map_values` to replace the value of each key in the new top-level lookup table (initially a simple array of breach names) with a dictionary that contains two keys:
   1. `Breaches` — an array of dictionaries indexed by `Name`, `Title` & `DataClasses` . Use the `map` function to process the entire array in one step.
   2. `ExposureScore` — a value calculated from the enriched breach details that starts at 0, and adds 1 for each breach the user is caught up in that does not contain passwords, and 10 for each breach that does. Use the `reduce` function to perform this calculation.

We'll use the dummy HIBP export for the imaginary domain `demo.bartificer.net` to test our solution, and you'll find that export in the instalment ZIP as `hibp-pbs.demo.json`. To enrich the data we'll need an export of all the breaches HIBP knows, which we can download for free as described in [instalment 164](./pbs164). For convenience, the instalment ZIP includes a copy of the database as it was on the 4th of June 2024 in the file `hibp-breaches-20240604.json`.

You'll find a full sample solution in the file `pbs166-challengeSolution.jq` in the instalment zip:

```jq
# Enrich the breach data in a domain report from the Have-I-Been-Pwned service.
# Input:    JSON as downloaded from the HIBP service
# Output:   A Lookup-style dictionary with breach data for domain users indexed
#   by email username (the part to the left of the @). For each user lookup
#   table maps to a dictionary indexed by:
#   - Breaches:         An array of dictionaries describing the breaches the
#                       user was snared in.
#   - Exposure Score:   A measure of how exposed the user is.
# Variables:
# - $breachDetails	An array containing a single entry, the JSON for the
#                   latest lookup table of HIBP breaches indexed by breach
#                   name

# Keep just the Breach details
.Breaches

# re-build the values for every key
| map_values({
    # build the enriched breach data
    Breaches: map({
        Name: .,
        Title: $breachDetails[0][.].Title,
        DataClasses: $breachDetails[0][.].DataClasses
    }),

    # calculate the exposure score
    ExposureScore: (reduce .[] as $breachName (0; 
        . + (($breachDetails[0][$breachName].DataClasses | contains(["Passwords"]) // empty | 10 ) // 1 )
    ))
})
```

As you can see, promoting the breaches lookup table to the top-level element is as simple as filtering down to it by name, so that is simply `.Breaches`.

At the top level we now have a lookup table with arrays if breach names indexed by email usernames like this:

```json
{
  "josullivan": [
    "OnlinerSpambot"
  ],
  "egreen": [
    "Dropbox"
  ],
  "mwkelly": [
    "Dropbox",
    "KayoMoe",
    "LinkedIn",
    "LinkedInScrape",
    "PDL"
  ],
  "ahawkins": [
    "iMesh",
    "OnlinerSpambot"
  ],
  "ptraynor": [
    "Collection1"
  ]
}
```

We need to transform the values in this lookup table from arrays of strings to arrays of dictionaries, so we'll start by wrapping all our work in a call to `map_values`. The first thing we will need the filter passed as the only argument to `map_values` to do is construct a new dictionary with two keys, `Breaches` and `ExposureScore`, so big-picture wise our solution will be structured like this:

```jq
| map_values({
    # build the enriched breach data
    Breaches: SOMETHING,
    ExposureScore: SOMETHING
})
```

Let's look at how to calculate each value in turn, starting with the new breaches list. The input to this filter will be a single current value from the top-level dictionary, so something like:

```json
[
  "iMesh",
  "OnlinerSpambot"
]
```

That is to say, we have an array of strings, and we want an array of dictionaries. We transform the strings to dictionaries without exploding and re-capturing the array using the `map` function. In the filter passed as the only argument to `map`, the current value will be a single breach name as a string. That means that this part of our solution will have the following basic form:

```jq
map({
  Name: SOMETHING,
  Title: SOMETHING,
  DataClasses: SOMETHING
})
```

Since the original value being transformed is a breach name, `Name` can simply be given the value `.`. The name is also used to index our list of all known breaches from HIBP, so if we import that list into our script with `--slurpfile` and give it the name `$breachDetails` then we can get the title and data classes with `$breachDetails[0][.].Title` & `$breachDetails[0][.].DataClasses`. Remember, `--slurpfile` wraps the data it imports into an array in case there are multiple values, so our lookup table is not at `$breachDetails`, but at `$breachDetails[0]`.  Putting all that together we can calculate our new enrich arrays of breach details with:

```jq
map({
  Name: .,
  Title: $breachDetails[0][.].Title,
  DataClasses: $breachDetails[0][.].DataClasses
})
```

The final piece of the puzzle is to calculate our exposure score. Here we are condensing a list of breaches into a single number, so we are *reducing* an array, hence, we use the `reduce` function. We start with an exposure score of `0`, and for each breach that has no passwords we add `1`, and for each breach that does have passwords we add `10`. We can figure out whether or not a breach has passwords using our enrichment data in `$breaches[0]` — if the array `breachDetails[0][$breachName].DataClasses` contains the string `Passwords` then the breach contained passwords. One small subtlety to remember is that to use the `contains` function to check array containment rather than substring containment we need to pass an array **both** as input **and** as the argument, so it needs to be `contains(["Passwords"])` rather than simply `contains("Passwords")`.

Next, we need to add the appropriate amount each time, and the key to that is the *alternate* operator, or `//`. Remember that if the left-hand-side evaluates to anything that's not `empty`, `false`, or `null`, then the right-hand-side is evaluated. In effect, we need to implement the simple logic *'if true, evaluate to 10, and if false evaluate to 1'*. Because we've not yet learned about jq's `if` operator we need to achieve this logic with the *alternative operator* (`//`), which is actually quite tricky!

The key to making this work is that if you pipe any value to a filter with a literal value the output is that literal value, e.g.:

```sh
# -n for no input
jq -n 'true | 10' # outputs 10
```

But, if you pipe nothing to anything, the pipe never happens, so the output is still nothing, i.e. `empty`. We can prove this to ourselves with the following commands which pipe nothing to a filter with a literal value  — both output nothing at all rather than `10`:

```sh
# create then explode an empty array
jq -n '[] | .[] | 10' # no output

# explicitly send no input
jq -n 'empty | 10' # no output
```

We can use this jq behaviour in conjunction with two *alternative* operators to get our `1` or `10` as appropriate with:

```jq
(($breachDetails[0][$breachName].DataClasses | contains(["Passwords"]) // empty | 10 ) // 1
```

To understand why this works, let's break it down for a breach which does contain passwords, and then again for one that doesn't. Note that the output from the `contains` filter will be `true` or `false`. 

So, when a breach does contain a password what we in effect have is:

```jq
(true // empty | 10 ) // 1
```

The first alternative operator has a value on the left that is not `empty`, `null`, or `false`, so the right-hand-side never happens, and  `true` gets piped to the filter `10`, producing a `10` on the left of the second alternative operator, so it's right-hand side also does not happen, and the final output is `10`.

Now, what happens when the breach does not contain a password? In that case we effectively have:

```jq
(false // empty | 10 ) // 1
```

In this case the left-hand-side of the first alternative operator is `false`, so the right-hand-side does happen, and `empty` gets piped to `10`, producing `empty` as the left-hand-side of the second alternative operator. This means that it's right-hand-side happens too, so the final output is `1`.
