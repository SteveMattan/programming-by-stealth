# PBS 169 of X — YAML: Advanced Topics

Having explained why we might be interested in learning YAML, and explored its uses and philosophy, we went on to learn the basic syntax. There are two important additional concepts we didn't cover — multi-line strings, and the more efficient optional syntactic sugar for simple nested elements as teased at the end of the previous instalment.

Finally, since we've just finished exploring the `jq` command and language, it would seem remiss of me not to include a section on using the related `yq` command for querying YAML data in the jq language.

## Multi-Line Strings (String Blocks)

YAML provides many ways to render multi-line strings, and they ensure you can sane indent your code without having un-intended consequences for the contents of your strings.

The full detail of every possible way in which you can type a multi-line string into a YAML file is simply too much for this quick overview, if you want all the details I recommend [this excellent Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21699210).

### Flow Style Multiline Strings (Avoid in Your own YAML)

If you just type a string over multiple lines without quoting it or using any kind of operator it will work, and that is what is known as the *flow style*. Superficially, these behave quite sensibly, but the advice is to avoid them because they come with some serious pitfalls.

Before we go any further, here's some YAML with example flow-style multi-line strings:

```yaml
---
Flow Style String 1: This is a string in the flow style
  within a mapping, so it uses indentation.
  
  This is a second paragraph within a flow style string.
Flow Style String 2:
  
  This is also a flow style string with two paragraphs
  
  But it has padding lines around it

Some Other Key: 42
```

This converts to the following JSON markup:

```json
{
  "Flow Style String 1": "This is a string in the flow style within a mapping, so it uses indentation.\nThis is a second paragraph within a flow style string.",
  "Flow Style String 2": "This is also a flow style string with two paragraphs\nBut it has padding lines around it",
  "Some Other Key": 42
}
```

Notice that YAML's default behaviour was indeed quite sensible — it silently absorbed the padding so that didn't mess up the string, it also replaced the single internal newline character between `flow style` and `  within a mapping`, it collapsed the paragraph breaks into single newline characters, and padding lines above and below were ignored.

That does all seem very sensible, but, remember I mentioned there were pitfalls? I'll defer to the previously mentioned stack overflow answer for a summary:

> … no escaping, no ` #` or `: ` combinations, first character can't be `"`, `'` or many other punctuation characters …

So, it's important to be able understand these flow style strings in other people's YAML, but my advice is **never use the flow style for strings, always use the more explicit string blocks**!

### String Blocks (Always Use)

Before describing the potentially confusing string block syntax, let's stop and think for a minute, and ask ourselves what aspects of the string we want to control?

1. We need to decide how internal newline characters are handled
2. We need to decide how trailing white space is handled

Note that all the permutations of string blocks handle indentation for you, so that's not something you have to worry about!

In YAML's world view, you control the handling of internal newline characters by choosing a *block operator*, and you control the handling of trailing white space with an optional *chomp indicator*.

**You start your multi-line strings with one of the two string block operators, optionally followed by a chomp indicator, and then you start content of your string on the next line.**

So, let's start by describing the two block operators:

| String Block Operator  | Syntax | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The *literal* operator | `|`    | New line characters are preserved and the indentation at the start of every new line is ignored. **Allows multi-line strings to be indented**. |
| The *fold* operator    | `>`    | New line characters and the indentation at the start each new line are collapsed into a single space. **Allows a single line string to be written across multiple lines**. |

Now, let's describe the optional chomp indicators:

| Chomp Indicator              | Syntax | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The *strip* indicator        | `-`    | All trailing white space (including newline characters) is removed. |
| The default *clip* behaviour |        | When no chomp indicator is added, YAML *clips* the trailing white space by replacing it all with a single trialing newline character. |
| The *keep* indicator         | `+`    | All trailing white space (including newline characters) is retained. |

That sounds complicated, but let's look at an example YAML document that defines an array with multiple copies of the same string, each using a different combination of block operator and chomp indicator:

```yaml
---
# litertal operator with default clip behaviour
- |
  Hello
  World!
  
# fold operator with default clip behaviour
- >
  Hello
  World!
  
# literal operator with strip chomp indicator
- |-
  Hello
  World!
  
# fold operator with strip chomp indicator
- >-
  Hello
  World!
  
# literal operator with keep chomp indicator
- |+
  Hello
  World!
  
# fold operator with keep chomp indicator
- >+
  Hello
  World!
  
```

Converting this to JSON we get the following array:

```json
[
  "Hello\nWorld!\n",
  "Hello World!\n",
  "Hello\nWorld!",
  "Hello World!",
  "Hello\nWorld!\n\n",
  "Hello World!\n\n"
]
```

Let's map those strings to the operators that produced them to better understand what happened:

| Operator | Generated String      | Explanation                                                  |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `|`      | `"Hello\nWorld!\n"`   | The default literal behaviour is to ignore the indentation and keep just one trialing newline character. |
| `>`      | `"Hello World!\n"`    | The default fold behaviour is to collapse the newlines and the indentation into a single space, and to keep just one trailing newline character. |
| `|-`     | `"Hello\nWorld!"`     | The literal operator with strip indicator ignored the indentation and all the trailing white space. |
| `>-`     | `"Hello World!"`      | The fold operator with the strip indicator collapsed the newlines and the indentation into a single space, and, stripped all the trailing white space. |
| `|+`     | `"Hello\nWorld!\n\n"` | The literal operator with the keep indicator ignored only the indentation, it kept all the newline characters, including the empty line at the end of the block. |
| `|-`     | `"Hello World!\n\n"`  | The fold operator with the keep indicator collapsed the internal newline characters and indentation to single spaces, but kept all the trailing white space. |

## Flow Style Sequences & Mappings (JSON-Like)

At the end of the previous instalment I teased that YAML provides an optional more compacted syntax for adding simple sequences and mappings. The example of why we need it is this simply nested array:

```yaml
---
- 1
- 
  - 2
  - 3
```

Using compact JSON notation this becomes simply `[1,[2,3]]`.

This is where YAML's optional flow style for sequences and mappings comes in. YAML has basically learned from JSON, so it supports a JSON-like syntax that is actually much more forgiving than true JSON, but will be instantly familiar to anyone with JSON experience. Unless there's some kind of ambiguity, neither key names nor strings need to be quoted, as illustrated in these example documents:

```yaml
---
{Jim Kirk: To boldy go, Jean Luc Picard: Make it so!}
---
[this is a string, so is this!]
```

Converting these two documents to JSON we get the following dictionary and array:

```json
{
  "Jim Kirk": "To boldy go",
  "Jean Luc Picard": "Make it so!"
}
[
  "this is a string",
  "so is this!"
]
```

The reason we could get away without any kind of quoting is that the keys in the mapping didn't contain colons, and the strings didn't contain comas or other characters with meaning in the the flow syntax like `]` and `}`.

While you can avoid quoting surprising often, you can't always avoid it. For example, the following does not work as expected:

```yaml
---
{William Shakespear: To be or not to be, that is the question}
```

Converting the above to JSON we do not get what we expect:

```json
{
  "William Shakespear": "To be or not to be",
  "that is the question": null
}
```

Why? Because the coma ends the value for the key `William Shakespear` and starts a new key named `that is the question` with no value at all, which is interpreted as `null`.

The solution is of course to quote Shakespear's excerpt:

```yaml
---
{William Shakespear: 'To be or not to be, that is the question'}
```

This now converts to the expected JSON dictionary:

```json
{
  "William Shakespear": "To be or not to be, that is the question"
}
```

You can of course mix-and-match the regular and flow styles, which is in fact how you usually see the flow style used:

```yaml
---
Monday: [Mon, mon, M]
Tuesday: [Tue, tue, Tu]
Wednesday: [Wed, wed, W]
Thursday: [Thur, thur, Th]
Friday: [Fri, fri, F]
Saturday: [Sat, sat, Sa]
Sunday: [Sun, sun, Su]
---
- {Name: Bob, Emial: bob@burgers.com}
- {Name: Ken, Email: ken@barbie.com}
```

When we run this through `qy` we get the following JSON dictionary or arrays and array of dictionaries:

```json
{
  "Monday": [
    "Mon",
    "mon",
    "M"
  ],
  "Tuesday": [
    "Tue",
    "tue",
    "Tu"
  ],
  "Wednesday": [
    "Wed",
    "wed",
    "W"
  ],
  "Thursday": [
    "Thur",
    "thur",
    "Th"
  ],
  "Friday": [
    "Fri",
    "fri",
    "F"
  ],
  "Saturday": [
    "Sat",
    "sat",
    "Sa"
  ],
  "Sunday": [
    "Sun",
    "sun",
    "Su"
  ]
}
[
  {
    "Name": "Bob",
    "Emial": "bob@burgers.com"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Ken",
    "Email": "ken@barbie.com"
  }
]
```

## Using `yq` to Query YAML Files

As mentioned in the previous instalment, I used the command line tool `yq` to convert the YAML snippets in the show notes to JSON.

This tool has some very lofty goals — the aim being to allow any of the common data formats to be queries using the jq syntax. As we record these shows (summer 2024), `yq` implements all the commonly used features of the jq language, and it supports the most popular data formats, including YAML, JSON, XML & CSV. Work is on-going to add better TOML support, and to add support for the outstanding jq language features.

One of the things that makes this tool appealing is that it's written from the ground up in the modern Rust language, so it benefits from the secure-by-design features built into Rust, and has no dependencies!  You can get all the details on their [GitHub page](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq), and on the Mac you can install it via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with the command:

```sh
brew install python-yq
```
