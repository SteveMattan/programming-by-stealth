# PBS 156 of X — Extracting Data with `jq`

In the previous instalment we got a glimpse of what jq can do, and we looked at some examples of `jq` in action, but we didn't explain the code in any of the filters. We did draw attention to how dense the language was, and how much opportunity there is for confusion. In an attempt to avoid confusion, we're going to learn the jq language in a slow and incremental way, building on our knowledge as we go.

We're going to start our jq journey today by exploring how we can use `jq` to extract specific pieces of information from JSON files.

## It Starts with `.`

In jq, a leading period (`.`) represents *the item currently being processed*.

So, the jq filter `'.'` simply means the entire input.

Generally speaking, a JSON data structure has a top-level element that is a dictionary or an array, so to extract a specific piece of data, we need to descend into the current item, which we do by adding extra syntax to the right of the leading dot.

## Descending into Dictionaries

To access a given property in a dictionary we simply use its name.

In the instalment ZIP you'll find an example NPM package information file (`this-ti.me-package.json`), which has a dictionary as the top-level element. We can access the value for the key-value pair with the key `name` with the jq filter `'.name'`:

```bash
jq '.name' this-ti.me-package.json
```

If a dictionary contains more dictionaries we can keep descending down key by key by concatenating the keys with further dots. For example, in the sample NPM package file the top-level key `bugs` has a value that's also a dictionary which contains the key `url`, we can access that key's value with the jq filter `'.bugs.url'`:

```bash
jq '.bugs.url' this-ti.me-package.json
```

This basic syntax works great when the keys are free from special characters, but what if the keys have spaces or other special characters in them? In that case, we need to double-quote the key name. As an example, the `dependencies` key in the example NPM package file has a value that is another dictionary, and it has many key-value pairs with special characters in their key name, we can access them all by double-quoting the key names, e.g.:

```bash
jq '.dependencies."is-it-check"' this-ti.me-package.json
jq '.dependencies."@fortawesome/fontawesome-free"' this-ti.me-package.json
```
