# PBS 156 of X — Extracting Data with `jq`

In the previous instalment we got a glimpse of what jq can do, and we looked at some examples of `jq` in action, but we didn't explain the code in any of the filters. We did draw attention to how dense the language was, and how much opportunity there is for confusion. In an attempt to avoid confusion, we're going to learn the jq language in a slow and incremental way, building on our knowledge as we go.

We're going to start our jq journey today by exploring how we can use `jq` to extract specific pieces of information from JSON files.

## It Starts with `.`

In jq, a leading period (`.`) represents *the item currently being processed*.

So, the jq filter `'.'` simply means the entire input.

Generally speaking, a JSON data structure has a top-level element that is a dictionary or an array, so to extract a specific piece of data, we need to descend into the current item, which we do by adding extra syntax to the right of the leading dot.

## Descending into Dictionaries

To access a given property in a dictionary we simply use its name.

In the instalment ZIP you'll find an example NPM package information file (`this-ti.me-package.json`), which has a dictionary as the top-level element. We can access the value for the key-value pair with the key `name` with the jq filter `'.name'`:

```bash
jq '.name' this-ti.me-package.json
```

If a dictionary contains more dictionaries we can keep descending down key by key by concatenating the keys with further dots. For example, in the sample NPM package file the top-level key `bugs` has a value that's also a dictionary which contains the key `url`, we can access that key's value with the jq filter `'.bugs.url'`:

```bash
jq '.bugs.url' this-ti.me-package.json
```

This basic syntax works great when the keys are free from special characters, but what if the keys have spaces or other special characters in them? In that case, we need to double-quote the key name. As an example, the `dependencies` key in the example NPM package file has a value that is another dictionary, and it has many key-value pairs with special characters in their key name, we can access them all by double-quoting the key names, e.g.:

```bash
jq '.dependencies."is-it-check"' this-ti.me-package.json
jq '.dependencies."@fortawesome/fontawesome-free"' this-ti.me-package.json
```

## Descending into Arrays

To descend into an array, the syntax is very Javascript-like — append a numeric index wrapped by square brackets. Note that indexes start at zero as is the norm for programming languages.

A nice extra feature offered by jq is negative indexes to count from the end of the array, with `-1` being the last element, `-2` the second last etc..

## Output Un-Quoted Strings

By default, `jq` outputs all values in JSON syntax. For data structures, i.e. arrays and dictionaries, it’s difficult to see what  else `jq` could do, but for single values the default behaviour can cause problems with strings.

The JSON for booleans and numbers are indistinguishable from  strings from the shell’s point of view, but JSON strings are wrapped in double quotation marks, which are often unwanted when using the output from `jq` in shell scripts or on the command line. 

This is where the `—raw-output` or `-r` flag comes into play.

## `jq` Works in Parallel

If you pass `jq` input with multiple top-level JSON items, whether that be from `STDIN`, from a single file, or from multiple files, `jq` runs its filter on each separately, and outputs all the answers on separate lines.

TO DO — example

Sometimes it’s useful to automatically combine all the inputs into a single top-level JSON object so the filter only gets applied once, you can use the `—slurp` or `-s` flag to do that.

You can also tweak the output behaviour with the `—join-output` or  `-j` flag which behaves like `-r` and also uses spaces instead or new lines to separate the outputs.
