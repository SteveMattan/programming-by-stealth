## PBS 159 of X — jq: Manipulating Data

In this instalment we're tackling the final of the three tasks `jq` can help us with — we've already seen how to pretty-print JSON, and how to search JSON, now, we're going to learn how to transform the data we've selected so our outputs can have a different format to our inputs.

## Mathematical Operators & Functions

Let's start nice and simple, the jq language supports the usual suspects in terms of mathematical operators:

| Operator | Description        | Example                      |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition           | `jq -n '1 + 1'` produces `2` |
| `-`      | Subtraction        | `jq -n '3 - 1'` produces `2` |
| `*`      | Multiplication     | `jq -n '2 * 1'` produces `2` |
| `/`      | Division           | `jq -n '4 / 2'` produces `2` |
| `%`      | Modulo (remainder) | `jq -n '5 % 3'` produces `2` |

Note the use of the `-n` flag in the examples to tell the `jq` command not to expect any input to process.

Something to notice is that the jq language does not support the increment and decrement operators `++` and `--`.

As well as these operators, the jq language also provides built in functions for performing arithemtic. We won't explore all the functions that exist, just some of those you're most likely to find useful. To make the examples shorter to write and easier to interpret we'll use a JSON file contianing an array of numbers as th input, specifically the file `numbers.json` in the instalment ZIP:

```json
[
	-42,
	0,
	11,
	42
]
```



| Function             | Description                              | Example                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `abs` (no arguments) | Outputs the absolute value of the input. | `jq .[]|abs` outputs `42`, `0`, `11` & `4` |
| `floor`              |                                          |                                            |
| `sqrt`               |                                          |                                            |
| `min` & `min_by`     |                                          |                                            |
| `max` & `max_by`     |                                          |                                            |

## String Manipulation

### Trimming with `ltrimstr` & `rtrimstr`

### Case Manipulation with ``ascii_downcase` & `ascii_upcase`

### The `sub` function

### Formatting & Escaping with `@`

### ## Converting Between Strings & Arrays with `split` & `join`

## Array Manipulation

### Addition & Subtraction

### Re-Ordering (`sort` & `reverse`)

### Deduplication (`unique` & `unique_by`)

### Flattening with `flatten`

### The `map` Function

## Dictionary Manipulation

### Addition & Subtraction

### The `del` Function

## Constructing new Outputs

### String Interpolation

Build a string describing Andrea Ghez's prize:

```bash
jq '.prizes[] | .laureates[]? | select(.surname == "Ghez") | "\(.firstname) \(.surname) was awarded her prize for \(.motivation)"' NobelPrizes.json --raw-output
# Andrea Ghez was awarded her prize for "for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy"
```

### Array Construction

Most common use is to re-combine multiple outputs from a filter into a single array for final output or to pipe to the next filter in the chain.

Often used as a syntactically shorter alternative to the `map` function.

### Dictionary Construction

Get the details of Dr. Andrea Ghez's Nobel prize as a new dictionary:

```bash
# Basic example — just extract top-level values
jq '.prizes[] | select(any(.laureates[]?; .surname == "Ghez")) | {year: .year, prize: .category}' NobelPrizes.json
# {
#  "year": "2020",
#  "prize": "physics"
# }

# Complex example — combine top-level and lower-level data, use string interpolation, and use string substitution
jq '.prizes[] | select(any(.laureates[]?; .surname == "Ghez")) | {year: .year, prize: .category, name: (.laureates[] | select(.surname == "Ghez") | "\(.firstname) \(.surname)"), citation: (.laureates[] | select(.surname == "Ghez") | .motivation | sub("\""; ""; "g"))}' NobelPrizes.json
# {
#  "year": "2020",
#  "prize": "physics",
#  "name": "Andrea Ghez",
#  "citation": "for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy"
#}
```
