## PBS 159 of X — jq: Manipulating Data

In this instalment we're tackling the final of the three tasks `jq` can help us with — we've already seen how to pretty-print JSON, and how to search JSON, now, we're going to learn how to transform the data we've selected so our outputs can have a different format to our inputs.

## Mathematical Operators & Functions

Let's start nice and simple, the jq language supports the usual suspects in terms of mathematical operators:

| Operator | Description        | Example                      |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition           | `jq -n '1 + 1'` produces `2` |
| `-`      | Subtraction        | `jq -n '3 - 1'` produces `2` |
| `*`      | Multiplication     | `jq -n '2 * 1'` produces `2` |
| `/`      | Division           | `jq -n '4 / 2'` produces `2` |
| `%`      | Modulo (remainder) | `jq -n '5 % 3'` produces `2` |

Note the use of the `-n` flag in the examples to tell the `jq` command not to expect any input to process.

Something to notice is that the jq language does not support the increment and decrement operators `++` and `--`.

As well as these operators, the jq language also provides built in functions for performing arithemtic.

To make the examples shorter to write and easier to interpret we'll use a pair of JSON files from the instalment ZIP in our examples. First, we'll use `numbers.json` which contains a single top-level array of numbers:

```json
[
	-42,
	0,
	3.1415,
	11
]
```

And we'll also use `menu.json` which contains a top-level array of dictionaries, each contianing keys that are numeric:

```json
[
	{
		"name": "hotdogs",
		"price": 5.99,
		"stock": 143
	},
	{
		"name": "pancakes",
		"price": 3.10,
		"stock": 43
	},
	{
		"name": "waffles",
		"price": 7.50,
		"stock": 14
	}
]
```

Note that some of these functions can tolerate having non-numbers sent to them, but many will throw errors for at least some non-numeric data types, so to be safe, only send numbers through these functions. Another thing to watch out for is that even when non-numeric values don't cause errors they can produce unexpected results, e.g. the absolute value of a string represatation of a negative number is the same string, un-changed — `jq -n '"-9.999" | abs'` outputs `"-9.999"`.

| jq Function         | Description                                                  | Example                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `abs`               | Outputs the absolute value of the input.                     | `jq .[]|abs` outputs`42`, `0`, `3.1415` & `11`               |
| `floor`             | Rounds input decimal numbers down to the integer part.       | `jq -n '3.1415 | floor'` outputs `3`, and `jq -n '9.999 | floor'` outputs `9` |
| `sqrt`              | Outputs the square root of the input.                        |                                                              |
| `min`               | Outputs the minimum value from an input array of numbers.    | `jq '. | min' numbers.json` outputs `-42`                    |
| `max`               | Outputs the maximum value from an input array of numbers.    | `jq '. | max' numbers.json` outputs `11`                     |
| `min_by(.KEY_PATH)` | Outputs the dictionary in an input array of dictionaries that has the minimum value for a given key. | `jq -c '. | min_by(.stock)' menu.json` outputs `{"name":"waffles","price":7.50,"stock":14}` |
| `max_by(.KEY_PATH)` | Outputs the dictionary in an inpuit array of dictionaries that has the maximum value for a given key. | `jq -c '. | max_by(.price)' menu.json` outputs `{"name":"waffles","price":7.50,"stock":14}` |

Those are the arithmetic functions provided by the jq language itself, but the `jq` command has a mathematical trick up its sleeve! All the standard 1, 2 & 3 argument C arithmetic functiuons from C's standard math library can be used in jq. 

For reason's I can't quite fathom the way in which one-argument C functions and two or three argument C functions get mapped to jq are not consistent. For one-argument C functions the input to the jq function gets passed as the C function's argument. But, for two and three argument C functions all arguments need to be specified in jq.

The exact functions available will depend on the version of the C libaries installed on the computer, but some widely available useful ones of note are:

| C Maths Function | Description                                                  | Example                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ceil`           | Round an input decimal number up to the nearest integer. An obvious companion for jq's built-in `floor` and C's `round` functions. | `jq -n '3.1415 | ceil'` outputs `4`, and `jq -n '9.999 | ceil'` outputs `10` |
| `round`          | Round an input decimal number up or down to the nearest integer. An obvious companion for jq's built-in `floor` and C's `ceil` functions. | `jq -n '3.1415 | round'` outputs `3`, and `jq -n '9.999 | round'` outputs `10` |
| `pow`            | Raise an input number to the power passed as the first argument. | `jq -n '2 | pow(.; 3)'` outputs `8`                          |

## Parsing Strings to Dictionaries with `capture`

Not only does the jq language support standard Perl-Compatible-Regular-Expressions (PCRE), it also supports the named-capture-groups extension to the standard. The built-in `capture` function makes use of this feature to use regular expressions to extract named pieces of data from strings.

In regular PCRE each opening round bracket (`(`) within a regular expression starts a new numbered capture group. With named capture groups you assign a name to each group instead of relying on automatic numbering. The name is specified within angled brackets (`<>`) after a question mark (`?`) at the start of the capture group.

That sounds more complicated than it really is, to capture the hours, minutes, and seconds of a time with capture groups you would use a regular expression like:

```pcre
(?<hours>[0-9]{1,2}):(?<minutes>[0-9]{2}):(?<seconds>[0-9]{2})
```

This RE has three named capture groups with colons between them. The first capture group is named `hours` and matches one or two digits, the second is named `minutes` and matches exactly 2 digits, and the third is named `seconds` and also matches exactly two digits. Remember that the character class `[0-9]` matches a digit, and the cardinality `{1,2}` means *at least one and at most two*, and the cardinarlity `{2}` means exactly two.

The built-in jq function `capture` requires the input be the string to be processed, and the first argument to be a string contianing a regular expression with named capture groups. The output will be a dictionary with key-value pairs for each named capture group in the regular expression. An optional second argument can be passed to specify PCRE flags like `i` for *case-insensitibve* as a single string.

Using our example RE above with jq we can parse times into their components like so:

```sh
jq -n '"9:00:00" | capture("(?<hours>[0-9]{1,2}):(?<minutes>[0-9]{2}):(?<seconds>[0-9]{2})")'
# {
#   "hours": "9",
#   "minutes": "00",
#   "seconds": "00"
# }
```

## Transforming Strings

As well as allowing us to transform numbers, the jq languages provides many mechanisms for transforming strings.

### 'Adding' Strings (and Operator Overloading)

The jq language has, to use programming jargon *overloaded* some of it's operators, including the addition (`+`) operator. Overloaded operators do different things when presented with different types of data to operate on. Many programming languages use overloading, and while we may not have called it out by name when we expored JavaScript, we did see operator overloading when we used `+` both for arithmetic addition, and for string concatenation.

Note that the jq language's support of operator overloading is basic compared to what we saw with JavaScript. JavaScript's operator overloading can handle different data types on each side of the operator, and them automatically *casts* (i.e. converts) one of the two to match the other before applying the appropriate action. This requires complex rules for determining what to do for every possible combination of types. In jq things are much simpler — **the types on each side of the overloaded operators must match**! 

Bringing this back to strings, like in JavaScript, jq's `+` operator is overloaded for both arithmentic addition and string concatenation  i.e. when both inputs are numbers they get added, and when both are strings they get concatenated:

```sh
# two numbers - arithmetic addition (as above)
jq -n '22 + 20' # oputputs 42

# two strings - concatenation
jq -n '"a string" + " another string"' # oputputs "a string another string"

# mismatched types
jq -n '"a string" + 42' # throws an error
```

As we'll learn later, the `+` operator is even more overloaded than this, it can also handle arrays and dictionaries!

### Built-in String Functions

The jq language provides a selection of built-in functions for manipulating strings, some of the more useful ones are listed below:

| Function         | Description                                                  | Example                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ascii_downcase` | Convert an input string to lower case.                       | `jq -n '"Somethin" | ascii_downcase'` outputs `"something"`  |
| `ascii_upcase`   | Convert an input string to upper case.                       | `jq -n '"Something" |ascii_upcase'` outputs `"SOMETHING"`    |
| `ltrimstr`       | Remove a given prefix from an input string, or return the string un-changed if the prefix is not present. | `jq -n '"DEBUG: something" | ltrimstr("DEBUG: ")'` outputs `"something"` |
| `rtrimstr`       | Remove a given postfix from an input string, or return the string un-changed if the postfix is not present. | `jq -n '"something (DEBUG)" | rtrimstr(" (DEBUG)")'` outputs `"something"` |
| `sub`            | Perform string substitution on an input string to produce the output string. A regular expression should be passed as the first argument, a replacement as the second, and optionally regular expression flags as a third. | `jq -n '"2023-11-12: Something" | sub("[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}: "; "")'` outputs `"Something"`, i.e. replaces a leading timestamp with an empty string. |

### Formatting & Escaping Values with `@`

When using the `jq` command to prepare strings for use in other applications you may need to escape or encode the strings in some way, and the jq language offers built-in support for many popular string escape formats, and data encoding formats.

The syntax for applying an encoding is to use the name of a supported encoding pre-fixed with an `@` symbol as filter. Different encoding support different input types, but all will output strings.

The `@text` and `@json` encodings support all input types, and output plain text and JSON respectively. Note that the `@text` encoding is equivalent to the `tostring` function.

The `@csv` and `@tsv` formats reqire arrays as inputs, and will produce strings in *coma-separated value*  and *tab-separated value* formats respectivesly. An important subtly to remember when using tese two format filters is that the `jq` command defaults to JSON-encoding all its outputs, so you need to remember to disable that default behaviour with the `-r` (`--raw-output`) flag we learned about at the start of this mini-series.

```sh
# build a one-line CSV file
echo '["pancakes", "waffles", "popcorn"]' | jq -r '@csv' | test.csv

# build a one-line TSV file
echo '["pancakes", "waffles", "popcorn"]' | jq -r '@rsv' | test.rsv
```

The string escaping formats require strings as inputs, and the following formats are supported:

| Encoding   | Description                                                  | Examples                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@html`    | Apply HTML escape sequences to the special characters in the input string. | `echo '"this & that"' | jq '@html'` outputs `"this &amp; that"` |
| `@uri`     | Apply URL/URI percent-encodings to the special characters in the input string. | `echo '"this & that"' | jq '@uri'` outputs `"this%20%26%20that"` |
| `@base64`  | Apply Base64 encoding to the input string.                   | `echo '"this & that"' | jq '@base64'` outputs `"dGhpcyAmIHRoYXQ="` |
| `@base64d` | Apply Base64 decoding to the input string.                   | `echo '"dGhpcyAmIHRoYXQ="' |jq '@base64d'` outputs `"this & that"` |
| `@sh`      | Apply POSIX Shell string escaping to the input string. It's important to **use raw output** with this format filter, i.e. use `jq -r`. | `echo '"this & that"'  | jq -r '@sh'` outputs `'this & that'` |

## Converting Between Strings & Arrays with `split` & `join`

Some jq fuctions only accept arrays or strings, and some always output arrays or strings, and sometimes those requirements don't line up with the inputs you need to send to the `jq` command for processing, or, that you need out of the `jq` command for further use. In those situations it can be very helpful to convert strings with some kind of separator into arrays, or arrays into strings with some kind of separator, and as their names suggest, that's what the built-in `split` & `join` functions do.

`split` requires a string as the input and a string representing the characters to split on as the first argument, and returns an array. For example:

```sh
jq -n '"1,2,3" | split(",")'
# [
#   "1",
#   "2",
#   "3"
# ]
```

`join` is effectively the inverse and requires an array as the input, a separator string to place between the array elements as the first argument, and returns a string. For example:

```sh
echo '[1, 2, 3]' | jq 'join(",")'
# "1,2,3"
```

As well as splitting on a string separator, jq can also split on a regular expression. When the `split` function receives just one argument it's interpreted as a string, but when it recieves two the first is interpreted as a regular expression, and the second as PCRE flags. This means that **when you don't need PCRE flags but you do need a regular expression you have to remember to pass an empty string as a second argument**. 

As a quick example we can split on a coma followed by an optional space by using the regular expression `[ ]?` with the two-argument form of the `split` function:

```sh
jq -n '"1,2,3" | split(",[ ]?"; "")'
# [
#   "1",
#   "2",
#   "3"
# ]
jq -n '"1, 2, 3" | split(",[ ]?"; "")'
# [
#   "1",
#   "2",
#   "3"
# ]
```

## Altering Arrays

Now that we've seen how to alter strings, let's take a look at way of transforming arrays.

### Re-Ordering Arrays (`sort` & `reverse`)

Let's start with the simplest type of array transformation — re-orderings.

The simplest re-ordering is a straight forward reversing, and jq provides just that with the `reverse` function:

```sh
jq -nc '[1, 2, 3] | reverse' # outputs [3,2,1]
```

Then of course we have array sorting.

When you have an array with simple values the built-in `sort` function will generally do what you want.

The function requires an array as input, and it will first group elements by type, starting with any `null` elements, then any booleans, then numbers, then strings, then arrays, and finally dictionaries. Within each grouping it will then perform the most sensible sorting, `false` before `true` for Booleans, numeric sorting for numbers, and alphabetic (lexical) sorting for strings. (Note that the rules for sorting arrays and dictionaries exist, but are out of the scope of this series).

Let's see the `sort` function in action:

```sh
# numbers
jq -nc '[1, 4, 3] | sort' # outputs [1,3,4]

# strings
jq -nc '["popcorn", "waffles",  "pancakes"] | sort' 
# outputs ["pancakes","popcorn","waffles"]

# mixed types
jq -nc '[42, true, 11, "waffles", false,  "pancakes"] | sort'
# outputs [false,true,11,42,"pancakes","waffles"]
```

When dealing with arrays containing more complicated elements like other arrays or dictionaries, you probably want to specify your own rule for sorting, you can do this with th `sort_by` function. It takes as an argument a filter, and that filter will be applied to each array element, and the elements will be sorted based on the results of applying the filter. Usually the filter is simply a dictionary key.

For example, we can re-order our menu (from the `menu.js` file in the instalment ZIP), with:

```sh
jq 'sort_by(.price)' menu.json
```

This outputs:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "pancakes",
    "price": 3.10,
    "stock": 43
  },
  {
    "name": "hotdogs",
    "price": 5.99,
    "stock": 143
  },
  {
    "name": "waffles",
    "price": 7.50,
    "stock": 14
  }
]
```

As you can see, the array is now sorted by price.

### Adding and Removing Elements with the  `+` & `-` Operators

As mentioned earlier, the `+` operator has been overloaded to perform a useful action when both inputs are arrays — it merges them into a new bigger array:

```sh
# Note: -n for no input & -c for compact output
jq -nc '[1, 2] + [3, 4]' # outputs [1,2,3,4]
```

While the `-` operator is not overloaded for strings, it is overloaded for arrays, and can be used create a new array with elements removed. The array to the left of the `-` is treated as the original array, and the elements in the array to the right of the `-` are removed from the original array, if present, to create the output array.

```sh
jq -nc '[1, 2, 3, 4] - [4, 5]' # outputs [1,2,3]
```

### Deduplication (`unique` & `unique_by`)

When you start adding arrays together it's easy to end up with duplucates that you may well not want. The jq language provides two useful functions for removing them.

Firstly, the simple `unique` function returns the input array sorted with any duplicated elements removed. The input must be an array. For exmaple:

```sh
jq -nc '[4, 1, 4, 3, 2] | unique' # outputs [1,2,3,4]
```

If you need a more complex definition of 'uniqueness' you can use the `unique_by` function to supply your own filter as an argument. The output array will only contain one element which the filter evaluates to a given value. If multiple elements evaluate to the same value, one will be kept, but there's no guarantee as to which one it will be. Also note that the elements in the output array will be sorted based on the result of the filter.

As a somewhat contrived example, we can make our menu (from `menu.json` above) unique by length of name. Before we do, let's compute the lengths see what results we expect, we can do that with:

```sh
jq '.[] | .name | length' menu.json
```

This shows that hotdogs and waffles have 7 letters, and pancakes 8. We would expect to always get pancakes in our answer, but only one of waffles or hotdogs when we make the menu unique by name. Let's try:

```sh
jq 'unique_by(.name | length)' menu.json
```

This gives us the output:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "hotdogs",
    "price": 5.99,
    "stock": 143
  },
  {
    "name": "pancakes",
    "price": 3.10,
    "stock": 43
  }
]
```

As expected, we get one item with a name of length 7, the one with a name of length 8, because the items are sorted on the result of the filter as well as deduplicated based on it.

### Flattening Nested Arrays

When assembling an array from multiple sources you may end up with an array of arrays when you actually wanted a single unified array. This is where the built-in `flatten` function comes in.

The `flatten` function takes an array as in input, and if it contains other arrays, it replaces them with their entries in the output array. The funtion applies this logic recursively, so you if your array contains arrays which contain arrays, it will still flatten them all out to a single array of all the values.

```sh
jq -nc '[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]] | flatten'
# outputs [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

By default the flatten function will keep recursing down into all nested arrays, but you can pass an optional argument to limit how deep it goes. To see what this means, let's repeat our above example with limits of 2 and 1:

```sh
# limit to a depth of 2
# arrays in the input array, and arrays in arrays in the input array
jq -nc '[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]] | flatten(2)'
# outputs [1,2,3,4,5,6]

# limit to a depth of 1
# arrays in the input array only
jq -nc '[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]] | flatten(1)'
# outputs [1,2,3,4,[5,6]]
```

### The `map` Function

After `select`, the most powerful function in `jq` is probably `map`. It takes an array as an input, and a filter as an argument, and it returns a new array containing the result of applying the filter to each element of the input array. In effect, it lets you **loop over an aray in a single function call**, and **process each element without exploding the array**.

Fo example, we can convert all the numbers in an array to their absolute values with:

```sh
jq -nc '[1, -2, 3, -42] | map(. | abs)'
# outputs [1,2,3,42]
```

Note that, like with the `select` function, the special `.` symbol means *'the current value being processed'*. That means that when processing the first element in the input array in the example above `.` is `1`, then it's `-2`, and so on.

## Dictionary Manipulation

### Addition & Subtraction

### The `del` Function

## Constructing new Outputs

### String Interpolation

Build a string describing Andrea Ghez's prize:

```bash
jq '.prizes[] | .laureates[]? | select(.surname == "Ghez") | "\(.firstname) \(.surname) was awarded her prize for \(.motivation)"' NobelPrizes.json --raw-output
# Andrea Ghez was awarded her prize for "for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy"
```

### Array Construction

Most common use is to re-combine multiple outputs from a filter into a single array for final output or to pipe to the next filter in the chain.

Often used as a syntactically shorter alternative to the `map` function.

### Dictionary Construction

Get the details of Dr. Andrea Ghez's Nobel prize as a new dictionary:

```bash
# Basic example — just extract top-level values
jq '.prizes[] | select(any(.laureates[]?; .surname == "Ghez")) | {year: .year, prize: .category}' NobelPrizes.json
# {
#  "year": "2020",
#  "prize": "physics"
# }

# Complex example — combine top-level and lower-level data, use string interpolation, and use string substitution
jq '.prizes[] | select(any(.laureates[]?; .surname == "Ghez")) | {year: .year, prize: .category, name: (.laureates[] | select(.surname == "Ghez") | "\(.firstname) \(.surname)"), citation: (.laureates[] | select(.surname == "Ghez") | .motivation | sub("\""; ""; "g"))}' NobelPrizes.json
# {
#  "year": "2020",
#  "prize": "physics",
#  "name": "Andrea Ghez",
#  "citation": "for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy"
#}
```
