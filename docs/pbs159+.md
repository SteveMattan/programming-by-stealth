## EPISODE DIVIDER — MANIPULATING DATA

## Mathematical Operators

## String Manipulation

### String Interpolation

### The `sub` function

### Any other string functions of Note

## Array Manipulation

### Sorting

### Deduplication

### The `map` Function

## Constructing new Outputs

### String Interpolation

Build a string describing Andrea Ghez's prize:

```bash
jq '.prizes[] | .laureates[]? | select(.surname == "Ghez") | "\(.firstname) \(.surname) was awarded her prize for \(.motivation)"' NobelPrizes.json --raw-output
# Andrea Ghez was awarded her prize for "for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy"
```

### Array Construction

Most common use is to re-combine multiple outputs from a filter into a single array for final output or to pipe to the next filter in the chain.

Often used as a syntactically shorter alternative to the `map` function.

### Dictionary Construction

Get the details of Dr. Andrea Ghez's Nobel prize as a new dictionary:

```bash
# Basic example — just extract top-level values
jq '.prizes[] | select(any(.laureates[]?; .surname == "Ghez")) | {year: .year, prize: .category}' NobelPrizes.json
# {
#  "year": "2020",
#  "prize": "physics"
# }

# Complex example — combine top-level and lower-level data, use string interpolation, and use string substitution
jq '.prizes[] | select(any(.laureates[]?; .surname == "Ghez")) | {year: .year, prize: .category, name: (.laureates[] | select(.surname == "Ghez") | "\(.firstname) \(.surname)"), citation: (.laureates[] | select(.surname == "Ghez") | .motivation | sub("\""; ""; "g"))}' NobelPrizes.json
# {
#  "year": "2020",
#  "prize": "physics",
#  "name": "Andrea Ghez",
#  "citation": "for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy"
#}
```
